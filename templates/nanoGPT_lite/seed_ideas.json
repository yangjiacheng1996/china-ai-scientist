    "Experiment": "Implement layer-wise learning rates, where each transformer layer has its own learning rate. Modify the configure_optimizers function to assign different learning rates to different layers, with deeper layers having lower learning rates. Compare the training dynamics, convergence speed, and final performance with the baseline model.",
