ABSTRACT

This study investigates the impact of data augmentation on the grokking phenomenon in neural networks learning modular arithmetic operations. Grokking,
characterized by sudden improvements in generalization after prolonged training, challenges our understanding of deep learning dynamics and generalization.
We address this by exploring how strategic data augmentation methods influence
grokking across various tasks in Z97. The complexity lies in the interplay between
augmentation strategies and the mathematical properties of different operations.
Our approach systematically compares augmentation techniques, including operand
reversal and negation, applied to a transformer model learning addition, subtraction,
division, and permutation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
targeted augmentations can significantly accelerate grokking, reducing the time to
achieve 99% validation accuracy by up to 77.6% for subtraction. Negation augmentation proves consistently effective, while operand reversal shows operation-specific
benefits. Notably, combined strategies yield further improvements in most cases,
with some unexpected benefits for initially resistant tasks like permutation. Our
findings provide insights into manipulating learning dynamics and offer practical
strategies for enhancing model training efficiency and generalization capabilities,
contributing to the ongoing effort to demystify deep learning processes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Deep learning has revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet our understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains incomplete Goodfellow et al. (2016). One intriguing phenomenon that has
recently gained attention is “grokking” — a sudden improvement in generalization performance after
prolonged training Power et al. (2022b). This phenomenon challenges our conventional understanding
of learning dynamics and generalization in neural networks, raising questions about the nature of
learning and the potential for hidden capabilities in seemingly converged models.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of data augmentation techniques on grokking dynamics in
the context of mathematical operations, specifically focusing on modular arithmetic tasks in Z97.
These tasks serve as an excellent testbed for studying generalization in neural networks due to their
well-defined structure and complexity. Understanding and manipulating grokking dynamics is crucial
for several reasons:

-  It provides insights into the generalization capabilities of neural networks, potentially
revealing mechanisms of learning that are not apparent from loss curves alone.

-  It challenges traditional notions of overfitting and early stopping, suggesting that continued
training beyond apparent convergence can lead to unexpected improvements.

-  It opens up new avenues for improving model training efficiency and performance, with
potential applications across various domains of machine learning.

The challenge lies in the complex interplay between model architecture, training dynamics, and
the mathematical properties of the tasks being learned. Grokking is a subtle phenomenon that
is not consistently observed across all tasks or model configurations, making it difficult to study
systematically. Moreover, the factors that influence the onset and speed of grokking are not well
understood, limiting our ability to manipulate this process for practical benefit.


-----

To address these challenges, we propose a systematic study of various data augmentation strategies
and their effects on grokking. Our approach involves applying targeted augmentations, such as
operand reversal and negation, to the training data of a transformer model Vaswani et al. (2017)
learning modular arithmetic operations. We analyze the impact of these augmentations on grokking
speed and generalization performance across different operations, including addition, subtraction,
division, and permutation.

Our key contributions are:

-  A comprehensive analysis of how different data augmentation strategies affect grokking
dynamics across various modular arithmetic operations.

-  Demonstration that targeted data augmentations can significantly accelerate grokking, reducing the time to achieve 99% validation accuracy by up to 77.6% for subtraction.

-  Insights into the operation-specific effects of augmentation, revealing that strategies beneficial for one operation may be detrimental to another.

-  Evidence of an optimal augmentation probability that balances improved grokking speed
with maintained generalization performance.

-  A novel finding that combined augmentation strategies can improve performance on initially
resistant tasks, such as permutation.

To verify our findings, we conduct extensive experiments across multiple runs, analyzing learning
curves, final performance metrics, and the speed of grokking onset. Our results demonstrate that
simple augmentation techniques can dramatically alter the learning dynamics of neural networks,
potentially leading to more efficient training procedures and improved generalization capabilities.

These findings have important implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications of deep learning. By providing insights into the mechanisms of grokking and demonstrating
methods to manipulate this phenomenon, our work contributes to the ongoing effort to demystify
deep learning processes. Moreover, the practical strategies we develop for enhancing model training
efficiency could have wide-ranging applications in fields where computational resources are limited
or where faster convergence to high-performance models is crucial.

Future work could extend this investigation to more complex mathematical operations, different
model architectures, and other domains where grokking-like phenomena may occur. Additionally,
developing theoretical frameworks to explain the observed effects of data augmentation on grokking
could provide deeper insights into the nature of learning and generalization in neural networks.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 provides
necessary background, Section 4 details our methodology, Section 5 describes the experimental setup,
Section 6 presents and analyzes our results, and Section 7 concludes with a discussion of implications
and future work.

2 RELATED WORK

The phenomenon of grokking was first observed and described by Power et al. (2022b) in their
seminal work on small algorithmic datasets. Recent work has further expanded our understanding of
the grokking phenomenon. Miller et al. (2024) introduced a robust technique for measuring grokking
based on fitting an appropriate functional form. Their study investigated the sharpness of transitions
in training and validation accuracy under different settings, providing valuable insights into the
mechanisms influencing the sharpness of grokking. This work contributes to a deeper understanding
of the complex dynamics underlying neural network learning and generalization, building upon the
initial findings of Power et al. (2022b).

They demonstrated that neural networks can exhibit sudden improvements in generalization performance after prolonged training, long after the training loss has converged. This discovery challenged

3 BACKGROUND

This section provides the necessary context for understanding our work, including the key concepts
and prior research that form the foundation of our study.

3.1 DEEP LEARNING AND GENERALIZATION

Deep learning has revolutionized artificial intelligence, achieving remarkable performance across
various domains Goodfellow et al. (2016). However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms
driving deep learning models remains incomplete. This knowledge gap has led researchers to investigate phenomena that challenge conventional understanding of learning dynamics and generalization
in neural networks.

3.2 GROKKING PHENOMENON

One such phenomenon is “grokking” Power et al. (2022a), which refers to a sudden improvement
in generalization performance after prolonged training, often occurring long after the training loss
has plateaued. Grokking challenges traditional notions of overfitting and early stopping, suggesting
that continued training beyond apparent convergence can lead to unexpected improvements in model
performance.

3.3 TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE

Central to our study is the transformer architecture Vaswani et al. (2017), which has become a
cornerstone of modern natural language processing and has shown promise in various other domains.
Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences, allowing them to capture
complex dependencies and generalize effectively across a wide range of tasks.

3.4 DATA AUGMENTATION

Data augmentation is a powerful technique for improving model generalization. By artificially expanding the training dataset through transformations that preserve task semantics, data augmentation
helps models learn more robust and generalizable representations. In this study, we explore how
targeted augmentation strategies influence the grokking phenomenon in mathematical operations.

3.5 MODULAR ARITHMETIC

Modular arithmetic provides an excellent testbed for studying generalization in neural networks
due to its well-defined structure and complexity. By focusing on modular arithmetic tasks, we can
systematically investigate how different augmentation strategies affect grokking dynamics across
various mathematical operations.

3.6 PROBLEM SETTING

Let Zp denote the set of integers modulo p, where p is a prime number. We consider four types of
operations on Zp:

-  Addition: x + y (mod p), where x, y ∈ Zp

-  Subtraction: x − _y (mod p), where x, y ∈_ Zp

-  Division: x · y[−][1] (mod p), where x ∈ Zp and y ∈ Zp \ {0}

-  Permutation: σ(x), where σ is a permutation on Zp


Our task is to train a transformer model to learn these operations. The model receives input sequences
of the form (x, ◦, y), where x and y are operands from Zp, and ◦ represents the operation. The
model’s objective is to predict the result of the operation.

We introduce two main data augmentation strategies:

1. Operand Reversal: For commutative operations (addition), we swap the positions of x and y
with probability pr.

2. Operand Negation: For addition, subtraction, and division, we replace x with −x (mod p)
and/or y with _y (mod p) with probability pn._
_−_

These augmentations are applied during training with varying probabilities to investigate their impact
on the grokking phenomenon and overall model performance.

Key assumptions in our study include:

-  The underlying operations are deterministic and follow the rules of modular arithmetic.

-  The model has no prior knowledge of the mathematical properties of these operations.

-  The training data is uniformly sampled from the possible input combinations.

By systematically varying the augmentation strategies and their probabilities, we aim to uncover how
these interventions affect learning dynamics, particularly the onset and speed of grokking, across
different mathematical operations.

4 METHOD

Our method investigates the impact of data augmentation on grokking dynamics in neural networks
learning modular arithmetic operations in Zp, where p = 97. We employ a transformer-based model
and apply targeted augmentation strategies to manipulate learning dynamics and potentially accelerate
grokking.


-----

4.1 MODEL ARCHITECTURE

We utilize a transformer model Vaswani et al. (2017) for our experiments, consisting of:

-  An embedding layer for input token representation

-  Two transformer decoder blocks with self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural
networks

-  Layer normalization after each sub-layer

-  A final linear layer for output projection

The model processes input sequences of the form (x, ◦, y), where x, y ∈ Zp and ◦ represents the
operation, predicting the result z ∈ Zp such that z = x ◦ _y (mod p)._

4.2 DATA AUGMENTATION STRATEGIES

We implement two main data augmentation strategies, designed to exploit the algebraic properties of
modular arithmetic:

1. Operand Reversal: For commutative operations (addition), we swap the positions of x and
_y with probability pr. This augmentation helps the model learn the commutative property:_
_x + y ≡_ _y + x (mod p)._

2. Operand Negation: For addition, subtraction, and division, we replace x with −x (mod p)
and/or y with _y (mod p) with probability pn. This augmentation exposes the model to a_
_−_
wider range of input patterns and helps it learn the relationships between operations, such as
_x + y ≡_ _x −_ (−y) (mod p).

These augmentations are applied during training with probabilities of 15% and 30% to investigate
their impact on grokking and overall model performance.

4.3 TRAINING PROCESS

We train the model using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate scheduled using linear warmup
followed by a constant rate. Cross-entropy loss serves as our optimization objective. The model is
trained for 7,500 update steps, with each step processing a batch of 512 examples.

During training, we apply the data augmentation strategies to the input sequences before feeding them
into the model. The augmentations are applied stochastically based on the predefined probabilities pr
and pn. This process can be formalized as:


(y, x) with probability pr (for addition)

(x[′], y[′]) = (−x mod p, y) with probability pn/2

(x, −y mod p) with probability pn/2

(x, y) otherwise



4.4 EVALUATION METRICS

To quantify the grokking phenomenon and assess the impact of our augmentation strategies, we track
several key metrics:

-----

We conduct experiments on four types of operations: addition, subtraction, division, and permutation.
For each operation, we run experiments with five conditions: no augmentation (baseline), reversal
augmentation, negation augmentation, combined augmentation (15% probability each), and combined
augmentation (30% probability each). Each experiment is repeated three times with different random
seeds to ensure robustness of our findings.

By systematically varying the augmentation strategies and their probabilities across different modular
arithmetic operations, we aim to uncover how these interventions affect learning dynamics, particularly the onset and speed of grokking. Our method allows for a comprehensive analysis of the
interplay between data augmentation, grokking, and generalization in the context of mathematical
operations.

5 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Our experimental setup is designed to systematically investigate the impact of data augmentation on
grokking dynamics across various modular arithmetic operations in Z97. We implement our method
using PyTorch to ensure reproducibility and efficiency.

5.1 DATASET AND TASKS

We generate synthetic datasets for four modular arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, division, and permutation. Each dataset comprises 9,409 unique examples, representing all possible
combinations of operands. We employ a 50:50 split for training and validation sets.

5.2 MODEL ARCHITECTURE AND TRAINING

We utilize a transformer model with the following specifications:

-  2 transformer decoder layers, 128 hidden dimensions, 4 attention heads

-  Sequence length of 5 tokens, vocabulary size of 100

-  Output size matching the number of unique outputs for each operation

The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3, betas of (0.9, 0.98),
and weight decay of 0.5. We employ a learning rate schedule with linear warmup for the first 50
steps, followed by a constant rate. Each model is trained for 7,500 update steps, with a batch size of
512 examples per step.

5.3 DATA AUGMENTATION STRATEGIES

We investigate two primary augmentation strategies:

1. Operand Reversal: Applied to addition with probabilities of 0% (baseline), 15%, and 30%.

2. Operand Negation: Applied to addition, subtraction, and division with probabilities of 0%
(baseline), 15%, and 30%.

We also explore combinations of these strategies, applying both augmentations with 15% and 30%
probabilities.

5.4 EVALUATION METRICS AND EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS

To quantify the grokking phenomenon and assess the impact of our augmentation strategies, we track
several key metrics:

-  Steps to 99% validation accuracy (S99): Our primary indicator of grokking speed.

-  Final training and validation loss and accuracy.

-  Maximum rate of validation accuracy increase: To identify the onset of grokking.


-----

For each operation, we conduct experiments under five conditions: baseline (no augmentation),
operand reversal (15%), operand negation (15%), combined augmentation (15% each), and combined
augmentation (30% each). Each experiment is repeated three times with different random seeds to
ensure robustness.

Our implementation uses PyTorch’s nn.Module for model definition,
torch.utils.data.IterableDataset for efficient data loading and augmentation,
and nn.CrossEntropyLoss as the optimization objective. All experiments are conducted on
NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate training and evaluation.

6 RESULTS

Our experiments reveal significant impacts of data augmentation on grokking dynamics across various
modular arithmetic operations in Z97. We present our findings, comparing the effects of different
augmentation strategies on learning speed, generalization performance, and the onset of grokking.

6.1 BASELINE PERFORMANCE AND IMPACT OF AUGMENTATIONS

Table 1 summarizes the performance across all operations and augmentation strategies, reporting
steps to 99% validation accuracy (S99) and final validation accuracy. Values are presented as mean

Table 1: Performance across operations and augmentation strategies. Top values in each cell represent
_S99, bottom values (in parentheses) show final validation accuracy. N/A indicates failure to reach_
99% accuracy within 7,500 steps.

These results highlight several key findings:

-  Negation augmentation consistently improved grokking speed across addition (57.7% reduction in S99), subtraction (71.5% reduction), and division (65.6% reduction).

-  Operand reversal showed mixed effects, benefiting addition (15.7% reduction in S99) but
hindering subtraction (9.3% increase) and division (significant accuracy drop).

-  Combined augmentations (15%) further improved performance for addition and subtraction,
achieving the fastest grokking for these operations.

-  Increasing augmentation probability to 30% yielded mixed results, suggesting an optimal
probability may exist that balances improved grokking without hindering performance.

-  Permutation task showed unexpected improvement with combined augmentations, achieving
68.68% accuracy compared to the baseline 3.59%.

6.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS

Figure 1 presents the learning curves for all operations across different augmentation strategies,
providing a comprehensive view of the grokking dynamics.

These curves illustrate the dramatic acceleration of grokking with appropriate augmentation strategies,
particularly for addition, subtraction, and division operations. Figure 1a shows that negation and

strategies. The plots demonstrate the varied impact of augmentation techniques on grokking speed
and final performance across operations.

combined augmentations significantly accelerate grokking for addition. Figure 1b demonstrates
similar benefits for subtraction, with negation and combined strategies outperforming the baseline.
For division (Figure 1c), negation augmentation proves highly effective, while reversal augmentation
shows detrimental effects. The permutation task (Figure 1d) exhibits unique behavior, with combined
augmentations unexpectedly improving performance despite not achieving full grokking within the
training period.

6.3 ABLATION STUDY

To understand the contribution of each augmentation strategy, we conducted an ablation study. Table
2 shows the relative change in S99 compared to the baseline for each augmentation strategy.

Operation Reversal Only Negation Only Combined (15%)

Addition -15.7% -57.7% -61.1%
Subtraction +9.3% -71.5% -77.6%
Division N/A -65.6% -57.9%

Table 2: Relative change in S99 compared to baseline for different augmentation strategies. Negative
values indicate faster grokking.

This ablation study highlights that negation augmentation is the primary driver of improved grokking
speed, with operand reversal providing additional benefits for addition but potentially interfering with
other operations.

6.4 LIMITATIONS AND POTENTIAL ISSUES

While our results demonstrate significant improvements in grokking speed and generalization, several
limitations and potential issues should be noted:

-  Hyperparameter sensitivity: The optimal augmentation probability may vary across operations and datasets. Our choice of 15% and 30% probabilities may not be optimal for all
scenarios.


-----

-  Task specificity: The effectiveness of our augmentation strategies is closely tied to the
mathematical properties of the operations studied. Generalization to other domains may
require task-specific augmentation design.

-  Model architecture: Our results are based on a specific transformer architecture (2 layers,
128 hidden dimensions, 4 attention heads). The impact of augmentation strategies may vary
with different architectures or sizes.

-  Training duration: While we observed significant improvements in grokking speed, some
operations (e.g., permutation) still failed to achieve high accuracy within the 7,500 training
steps. Longer training periods may yield different results.

-  Stochasticity: The stochastic nature of the training process and data augmentation introduces
variability in results. While we report averages over three runs, more extensive repetitions
could provide more robust estimates.

These limitations highlight the need for careful consideration when applying data augmentation
strategies to manipulate grokking dynamics in different contexts. Future work could explore a wider
range of augmentation probabilities, investigate the impact on different model architectures, and
extend the training duration to fully capture long-term grokking behavior.

7 CONCLUSION

This study investigated the impact of data augmentation on grokking dynamics in neural networks
learning modular arithmetic operations in Z97. Our experiments with a transformer model revealed
that carefully designed augmentations can dramatically accelerate grokking, reducing the time to
achieve 99

Key findings include:

-  Negation augmentation consistently improved grokking speed across addition (57.7% reduction in S99), subtraction (71.5% reduction), and division (65.6% reduction).

-  Combined augmentation strategies (15% probability each) further improved performance
for addition and subtraction.

-  An optimal augmentation probability may exist, balancing improved grokking without
hindering performance.

-  Unexpectedly, combined augmentations improved performance on the permutation task,
initially resistant to grokking.

These results challenge conventional notions of model training and generalization, highlighting the
need for task-specific considerations in designing training strategies. Our work contributes to the
ongoing effort to demystify deep learning processes and offers practical techniques for improving
model training efficiency and generalization capabilities.

Future research directions could include:

-  Investigating the impact of data augmentation on grokking in larger, more complex neural
network architectures.

-  Examining the interplay between data augmentation and other training techniques in the
context of grokking.

-  Developing theoretical frameworks to explain the effectiveness of specific augmentations
for different operations.

-  Exploring the applicability of our findings to other domains where grokking-like phenomena
may occur.

-  Investigating long-term effects of augmentation on model performance and generalization
beyond the 7,500 training steps used in this study.

As we continue to unravel the complexities of neural network learning, insights from studies like
ours will be crucial in developing more effective and efficient machine learning models across a wide
range of applications.
