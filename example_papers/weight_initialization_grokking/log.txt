*Starting Experiments*
Thank you for providing the detailed instructions. I understand the goal is to  
implement different weight initialization strategies for the Transformer model  
and compare them against the baseline. Here's the plan for the experiments:     

 1 Run 1: Xavier (Glorot) initialization                                        
 2 Run 2: He initialization                                                     
 3 Run 3: Orthogonal initialization                                             

We'll use these three runs to compare against the baseline results you've       
provided. Let's start with implementing the Xavier initialization for Run 1.

Thank you for providing the detailed instructions. I understand the goal is to implement different weight initialization strategies for the Transformer model and compare them against the baseline. Here's the plan for the experiments:

1. Run 1: Xavier (Glorot) initialization
2. Run 2: He initialization
3. Run 3: Orthogonal initialization

We'll use these three runs to compare against the baseline results you've provided. Let's start with implementing the Xavier initialization for Run 1.

Specifically, adjust the model initialization phase in the `Transformer` class to apply these strategies. Compare these against the baseline (PyTorch default) by measuring the final training and validation accuracy, loss, and the number of steps to reach 99% validation accuracy. Evaluate the results for each dataset and seed combination.

Now you can run the experiment with:

```
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

After you've run this experiment and collected the results, we can proceed with implementing the He initialization for Run 2.

I understand the error. The issue is that the output directory specified in the command line argument (run_1) doesn't exist when the script tries to write the final_info file. We need to create this directory before writing to it. Let's modify the `run` function in `experiment.py` to create the output directory if it doesn't exist.

 Analysis: Xavier initialization showed improvements in convergence speed for   
 most tasks compared to the baseline. The x_plus_y task saw a significant       
 reduction in steps to reach 99% validation accuracy. However, the x_minus_y ta 
 showed some instability in validation performance, indicating that Xavier      
 initialization might not be optimal for all arithmetic operations.

 Analysis: He initialization showed mixed results compared to Xavier            
 initialization. For x_div_y, it performed slightly better in terms of          
 convergence speed. However, for x_minus_y and x_plus_y, it showed slower       
 convergence and slightly lower final accuracies. The permutation task saw a    
 significant drop in validation accuracy, indicating that He initialization mig 
 not be suitable for this particular task. Overall, Xavier initialization still 
 appears to be more robust across different arithmetic operations.

Analysis: He initialization showed mixed results compared to Xavier initialization. For x_div_y, it performed slightly better in terms of convergence speed. However, for x_minus_y and x_plus_y, it showed slower convergence and slightly lower final accuracies. The permutation task saw a significant drop in validation accuracy, indicating that He initialization might not be suitable for this particular task. Overall, Xavier initialization still appears to be more robust across different arithmetic operations.

Now, let's implement the Orthogonal initialization for Run 3. We'll update the `_initialize_weights` method in the `Transformer` class:

```python

    def _initialize_weights(self):
        for module in self.modules():
            if isinstance(module, (nn.Linear, nn.Embedding)):

                if hasattr(module, 'bias') and module.bias is not None:
                    nn.init.constant_(module.bias, 0)
            elif isinstance(module, nn.LayerNorm):
                nn.init.constant_(module.weight, 1.0)
                nn.init.constant_(module.bias, 0.0)

    def _initialize_weights(self):

                if hasattr(module, 'bias') and module.bias is not None:
                    nn.init.constant_(module.bias, 0)
            elif isinstance(module, nn.LayerNorm):
                nn.init.constant_(module.weight, 1.0)
                nn.init.constant_(module.bias, 0.0)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

With these changes, we're ready to run the experiment with Orthogonal initialization. You can use the following command to execute Run 3:

```
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_3
```

This will run the experiment with Orthogonal initialization and save the results in the "run_3" directory. Once the experiment is complete, we can analyze the results and compare them with the previous runs.
I'll update the notes.txt file with the results of Run 3 and then propose the   
next experiment.

These changes implement the Kaiming Normal initialization for Run 4. You can now run the experiment using the command:

```
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_4
```

This will execute Run 4 with the Kaiming Normal initialization and save the results in the "run_4" directory. Once the experiment is complete, we can analyze the results and compare them to the previous runs.
I'll update the notes.txt file with the information for Run 4 and then propose  
the next experiment.

 Analysis: Kaiming Normal initialization showed mixed results compared to       
 previous initializations. It performed well on x_div_y and x_plus_y tasks,     
 achieving perfect accuracy with relatively fast convergence. However, it       
 struggled more on the x_minus_y task, showing lower accuracies and higher      
 losses. The permutation task saw good performance, with high accuracy but slow 
 convergence compared to some previous initializations. Overall, Kaiming Normal 
 initialization seems to be effective for certain arithmetic operations but may 
 not be the best choice for all tasks in this experiment.

performance of all initialization methods across datasets:

These changes will:                                                             

 1 Update the "labels" dictionary to include all the relevant runs (Baseline,   
   Xavier, He, Orthogonal, Kaiming Normal, and Uniform initializations).        
 2 Add a new function plot_summary that creates a summary plot comparing all    
   initialization methods across datasets.                                      
 3 Call the plot_summary function at the end of the script to generate the      
   summary plot.                                                                

The summary plot will show three metrics (final train accuracy, final validation
accuracy, and steps to 99% validation accuracy) for each initialization method  
across all datasets. This will provide a comprehensive view of how different    
initialization methods perform across various tasks.                            

With these changes, when you run python plot.py, it will generate:              

 1 Individual plots for training loss, validation loss, training accuracy, and  
   validation accuracy for each dataset.                                        
 2 A summary plot comparing all initialization methods across datasets.         

These plots should provide a clear visualization of the performance differences 
between the various initialization methods, helping to draw conclusions for the 
final writeup.

 1. Training Loss Plots (train_loss_[dataset].png):                             
    These plots show the training loss across different initialization methods  
 for each dataset. The x-axis represents the number of update steps, and the    
 y-axis shows the training loss. Each line represents a different initializatio 
 method, allowing for easy comparison of how quickly and effectively each metho 
 reduces the training loss over time. The shaded areas around each line represe 
 the standard error, giving an indication of the variability across different   
 runs.                                                                          
                                                                                
 2. Validation Loss Plots (val_loss_[dataset].png):                             
    Similar to the training loss plots, these graphs display the validation los 
 for each initialization method across update steps. These plots are crucial fo 
 understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data and for detecting  
 potential overfitting. Lower validation loss generally indicates better        
 generalization.                                                                
                                                                                
 3. Training Accuracy Plots (train_acc_[dataset].png):                          
    These plots illustrate the training accuracy over time for each             
 initialization method. The x-axis shows the number of update steps, while the  
 y-axis represents the training accuracy. These graphs help visualize how quick 
 and accurately each method learns the training data, with higher accuracy      
 indicating better performance on the training set.                             
                                                                                
 4. Validation Accuracy Plots (val_acc_[dataset].png):                          
    These graphs show the validation accuracy over time for each initialization 
 method. They are crucial for understanding how well the model generalizes to   
 unseen data. Higher validation accuracy suggests better performance on new,    
 unseen examples. The comparison between different initialization methods can   
 reveal which approach leads to better generalization.                          
                                                                                
 5. Summary Plot (summary_plot.png):                                            
    This comprehensive plot compares all initialization methods across datasets 
 for three key metrics:                                                         
    a. Final Training Accuracy Mean: The average final training accuracy for ea 
 method across all datasets.                                                    
    b. Final Validation Accuracy Mean: The average final validation accuracy fo 
 each method across all datasets.                                               
    c. Steps to 99% Validation Accuracy Mean: The average number of steps       
 required to reach 99% validation accuracy for each method across all datasets. 
                                                                                
    This plot provides a high-level overview of the performance of each         
 initialization method, allowing for quick comparisons across different dataset 
 and metrics. It's particularly useful for identifying which initialization     
 methods consistently perform well across various tasks.                        
                                                                                
 These plots collectively provide a comprehensive view of how different weight  
 initialization strategies affect the learning process, generalization ability, 
 and overall performance of the Transformer model across various arithmetic     
 tasks. They allow for in-depth analysis of the grokking phenomenon and how it' 
 influenced by different initialization approaches.
