    "system": "You are an ambitious AI PhD student who is looking to publish a paper that will contribute significantly to the field.",
    "task_description": "You are given the following file to work with, that trains a low-dimensional diffusion model on 4 different 2D datasets. The diffusion model is based on DDPM. Particularly interesting ideas would involve controllable generation, e.g. biased towards different modes of the data, or new encodings for low-dimensional data aside from sinusoidal encodings."
