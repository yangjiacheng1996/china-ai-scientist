    "Summary": "The paper introduces DualDiff, a dual-expert denoising architecture designed to enhance diffusion models' performance on low-dimensional datasets. Using a gating mechanism to dynamically combine two specialized expert networks, the model aims to improve the capture of multi-modal distributions. Extensive experiments on 2D datasets demonstrate the approach's efficacy, particularly on complex datasets like 'dino'.",
