    "Summary": "The paper investigates the impact of data augmentation on grokking dynamics in mathematical operations, focusing on modular arithmetic. It introduces a novel data augmentation strategy combining operand reversal and negation and applies it to a transformer-based model. The experiments show that this strategy significantly accelerates grokking, reducing training steps to achieve high validation accuracy across addition, subtraction, and division.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a challenging and underexplored problem in deep learning: grokking dynamics.",
        "Proposed data augmentation strategy is novel and shows significant improvements in experimental results.",
        "Thorough experimental setup with multiple conditions and repeated runs to ensure robustness.",
        "Potential applications in curriculum design for machine learning and educational AI systems."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks a clear theoretical explanation of why the proposed augmentations work.",
        "Clarity of the paper could be improved, especially in the presentation of results and figures.",
        "Novelty is somewhat limited as it builds on well-known techniques without fundamentally new insights.",
        "Potential broader impact and applications of the findings are not convincingly articulated.",
        "Does not sufficiently address potential limitations or negative societal impacts of the work.",
        "Reliance on a specific set of hyperparameters and model architectures limits generalizability."
