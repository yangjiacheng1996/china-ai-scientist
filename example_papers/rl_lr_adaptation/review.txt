    "Summary": "The paper proposes a Q-learning based approach to dynamically adjust the learning rate during transformer model training. By utilizing reinforcement learning, the method aims to enhance training efficiency and model performance. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets (shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8) demonstrate that the proposed approach can lead to faster convergence and better final performance compared to traditional learning rate schedules.",
