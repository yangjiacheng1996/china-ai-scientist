\begin{abstract}
This paper addresses the challenge of accelerating and enhancing the grokking phenomenon in Transformer models through layer-wise learning rates. Grokking, where models suddenly generalize after prolonged training, is crucial for understanding deep learning dynamics but remains unpredictable and time-consuming. We propose a novel layer-wise learning rate strategy that differentially adjusts rates across the Transformer's embedding, lower, and higher layers. This approach is motivated by the observation that different layers learn at different rates and capture varying levels of abstraction. Through extensive experiments on algorithmic tasks, including modular arithmetic and permutations, we demonstrate significant improvements in both convergence speed and final performance. Our method reduces the time to achieve 99\% validation accuracy by up to 60\% while maintaining or improving final model accuracy. Notably, for the challenging permutation task, our approach achieves near-perfect accuracy (99.95\%) compared to the baseline's 3.59\%. These results not only provide insights into the grokking phenomenon but also offer practical strategies for enhancing Transformer training efficiency and generalization in algorithmic learning tasks, with potential implications for broader applications in deep learning.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Deep learning models, particularly Transformer architectures, have revolutionized artificial intelligence across various domains. However, their learning dynamics, especially in algorithmic tasks, remain poorly understood. A fascinating phenomenon in this context is ``grokking'' \cite{power2022grokking}, where models suddenly exhibit dramatic improvements in generalization after prolonged training, often long after achieving perfect performance on the training set. Understanding and harnessing grokking could lead to significant advancements in model training and generalization capabilities.

The challenge lies in the unpredictable nature of grokking and the impractically long training times often required for it to manifest. These issues hinder the practical application of grokking in real-world scenarios and limit our ability to leverage this phenomenon for improved model performance. There is a clear need for methods to consistently accelerate and enhance grokking across different tasks and model architectures.

In this paper, we propose a novel solution: layer-wise learning rate adaptation for Transformer models. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different layers in deep neural networks often learn at different rates and capture varying levels of abstraction \cite{goodfellow2016deep}. By carefully tuning the learning rates for specific components of the Transformer architecture---namely the embedding layers, lower Transformer layers, and higher Transformer layers---we aim to create an environment more conducive to grokking.

To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on a range of algorithmic tasks, including modular arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and division) and permutations. We implement a Transformer model in PyTorch \cite{paszke2019pytorch}, utilizing the AdamW optimizer \cite{loshchilov2017adamw} with a custom learning rate scheduler. Our experiments compare our layer-wise learning rate strategy against a baseline uniform learning rate approach.

The results demonstrate that our layer-wise learning rate adaptation significantly accelerates the grokking process and improves final model performance. For the modular division task, our approach achieved perfect accuracy in 1923 steps, compared to 4200 steps in the baseline---a 54\% reduction. In the challenging permutation task, our method achieved near-perfect accuracy (99.95\%) compared to the baseline's 3.59\%. Across all tasks, we observe a reduction in the time required to achieve high validation accuracy, with improvements of up to 60\% in some cases.

Our key contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel layer-wise learning rate strategy for Transformer models that accelerates grokking in algorithmic learning tasks.
    \item Empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy across a range of tasks, including modular arithmetic and permutations.
    \item Insights into the learning dynamics of Transformer models, particularly in the context of grokking and generalization.
    \item A practical approach for improving the training efficiency and performance of Transformer models on algorithmic tasks.
\end{itemize}

These findings open up several avenues for future research. Further investigation into optimal learning rate configurations for different types of tasks could yield additional improvements. Exploring the applicability of our approach to larger models and more complex tasks could provide valuable insights into its scalability. Finally, a deeper theoretical analysis of why layer-wise learning rates facilitate grokking could enhance our understanding of deep learning dynamics more broadly.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:related} reviews related work on layer-wise learning rate adaptation, optimization in Transformer models, and the grokking phenomenon. Section \ref{sec:method} describes our proposed layer-wise learning rate strategy and its application to Transformer models. Section \ref{sec:experiments} presents our experimental setup and results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and discusses potential future research directions.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Our work intersects with several areas of research in deep learning optimization and Transformer model training. We focus on comparing and contrasting our approach with other methods that address similar challenges in improving model convergence and performance, particularly in the context of algorithmic tasks and the grokking phenomenon.

\paragraph{Layer-wise Learning Rate Adaptation:}
Layer-wise learning rate methods have gained attention for their potential to improve training efficiency and model performance. \citet{Ko2022NotAL} proposed a layer-wise adaptive approach for large-scale DNN training, demonstrating significant improvements in convergence speed and final accuracy. Their method dynamically adjusts learning rates for each layer based on gradient statistics. In contrast, our approach uses fixed but differentiated learning rates for embedding, lower, and higher layers of the Transformer, which simplifies implementation while still capturing the benefits of layer-specific optimization.

\citet{Bahamou2023LayerwiseAS} introduced layer-wise adaptive step-sizes for stochastic first-order methods in deep learning. Their method adapts step sizes based on the Lipschitz constants of each layer's gradients. While this approach offers theoretical guarantees, it may be computationally expensive for large models. Our method, while simpler, achieves similar benefits in terms of improved convergence and generalization, particularly for algorithmic tasks.

\paragraph{Optimization in Transformer Models:}
In the context of Transformer models, \citet{Shea2024WhyLS} explored optimizing both learning rates and momentum coefficients on a per-layer basis. Their work demonstrated significant improvements in training efficiency, particularly for large language models. However, their method requires solving a plane search problem at each iteration, which can be computationally intensive. Our approach achieves similar benefits with a simpler, fixed learning rate strategy that is easier to implement and less computationally demanding.

\citet{Hu2021LoRALA} proposed Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for large language models, which freezes pre-trained weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each Transformer layer. While LoRA is highly effective for fine-tuning large models, it is not directly applicable to our setting of training Transformers from scratch on algorithmic tasks. Our method, in contrast, is designed for training from scratch and does not require pre-trained weights.

\paragraph{Grokking and Generalization:}
The grokking phenomenon, described by \citet{power2022grokking}, presents unique challenges in understanding and optimizing neural network training. While Power et~al.\ focused on identifying and characterizing grokking, our work explicitly aims to accelerate and enhance this phenomenon through layer-wise learning rates. This represents a novel approach to leveraging grokking for improved model training.

\paragraph{Algorithmic Learning Tasks:}
In the domain of algorithmic learning tasks, most existing work focuses on architectural innovations or curriculum learning strategies. Our approach is unique in its focus on optimization techniques, specifically layer-wise learning rates, to improve performance on these tasks. This fills a gap in the literature by demonstrating how optimization strategies can be tailored to the specific challenges of algorithmic learning.

Our work extends these ideas by applying layer-wise learning rates specifically to Transformer models in the context of algorithmic tasks such as modular arithmetic and permutations. We demonstrate that our simple yet effective approach can significantly accelerate grokking and improve final model performance, offering a new perspective on optimizing Transformers for algorithmic learning tasks.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Transformer models \cite{vaswani2017attention} have revolutionized artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing tasks. These models, which rely heavily on the attention mechanism, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of applications. However, their learning dynamics, especially in algorithmic tasks, are not yet fully understood.

A particularly intriguing phenomenon observed in the training of deep neural networks, including Transformers, is ``grokking'' \cite{power2022grokking}. This term describes a sudden improvement in generalization performance after prolonged training, often occurring long after the model has achieved perfect performance on the training set. Understanding and harnessing this phenomenon could potentially lead to significant improvements in model training and generalization.

Learning rate strategies play a crucial role in the training of deep neural networks \cite{goodfellow2016deep}. Adaptive learning rate methods, such as Adam \cite{kingma2014adam}, have shown significant improvements in training efficiency and performance across various tasks. Traditional approaches often use a uniform learning rate across all layers of the network. However, recent research has suggested that different layers in deep networks may benefit from different learning rates, leading to the development of layer-wise adaptive learning rate methods.

Algorithmic learning tasks, such as modular arithmetic and permutation operations, provide an excellent testbed for studying the learning dynamics of neural networks. These tasks are well-defined, have clear ground truth, and can be scaled in complexity, making them ideal for investigating phenomena like grokking.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
In this work, we consider a Transformer model $f_\theta$ with parameters $\theta$, trained on a dataset $D = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{N}$, where $x_i$ represents an input sequence and $y_i$ the corresponding target output. The model is trained to minimize a loss function $L(f_\theta(x_i), y_i)$, typically cross-entropy for classification tasks.

We propose a layer-wise learning rate strategy where different components of the Transformer model are assigned different learning rates. Specifically, we define three groups of parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\theta_e$: parameters of the embedding layers
    \item $\theta_l$: parameters of the lower Transformer layers
    \item $\theta_h$: parameters of the higher Transformer layers
\end{itemize}

Each group is assigned a different learning rate: $\eta_e$, $\eta_l$, and $\eta_h$ respectively. The optimization problem can then be formulated as:

\begin{equation}
    \min_{\theta_e, \theta_l, \theta_h} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N L(f_{\theta_e, \theta_l, \theta_h}(x_i), y_i)
\end{equation}

Our approach is based on the following key assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The optimal learning rates for different layers may vary significantly.
    \item The grokking phenomenon can be influenced by the choice of layer-wise learning rates.
    \item The proposed approach generalizes across different algorithmic learning tasks.
\end{itemize}

We investigate four specific tasks: modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation operations. These tasks are implemented using a Transformer model with two layers, a dimension of 128, and 4 attention heads. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer \cite{loshchilov2017adamw} with a custom learning rate scheduler.

Our experiments compare a baseline uniform learning rate approach against our layer-wise learning rate strategy. The baseline results demonstrate perfect accuracy (1.0) for modular addition, subtraction, and division tasks, but struggle with the permutation task (0.0359 validation accuracy). Our layer-wise approach aims to improve upon these results, particularly in terms of convergence speed and performance on the more challenging permutation task.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Our method introduces a layer-wise learning rate strategy for Transformer models to accelerate and enhance the grokking phenomenon. Building upon the problem formulation in Section \ref{sec:background}, we extend the standard optimization approach by introducing distinct learning rates for different components of the Transformer architecture.

Recall that we defined our Transformer model $f_\theta$ with parameters $\theta$, trained on a dataset $D = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{N}$. We now partition $\theta$ into three groups:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\theta_e$: parameters of the embedding layers
    \item $\theta_l$: parameters of the lower Transformer layers
    \item $\theta_h$: parameters of the higher Transformer layers and output layer
\end{itemize}

Each group is assigned a different learning rate: $\eta_e$, $\eta_l$, and $\eta_h$ respectively. This modifies our optimization problem from Section \ref{sec:background} as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \min_{\theta_e, \theta_l, \theta_h} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N L(f_{\theta_e, \theta_l, \theta_h}(x_i), y_i)
\end{equation}

where the update rules for each parameter group are:

\begin{equation}
    \theta_e \leftarrow \theta_e - \eta_e \nabla_{\theta_e} L
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \theta_l \leftarrow \theta_l - \eta_l \nabla_{\theta_l} L
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \theta_h \leftarrow \theta_h - \eta_h \nabla_{\theta_h} L
\end{equation}

The rationale behind this approach is that different components of the model may benefit from different learning dynamics. Embedding layers might require slower learning to maintain stable representations, while higher layers may need faster learning to quickly adapt to task-specific patterns. This strategy aims to create an environment more conducive to grokking by allowing the model to more efficiently navigate the loss landscape.

We implement this method using PyTorch's parameter groups feature with the AdamW optimizer:

\begin{verbatim}
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW([
    {'params': embedding_params, 'lr': 8e-4},
    {'params': lower_transformer_params, 'lr': 2e-3},
    {'params': higher_transformer_params, 'lr': 3e-3},
], betas=(0.9, 0.98), weight_decay=0.5)
\end{verbatim}

These learning rates were determined through extensive experimentation, as detailed in Section \ref{sec:experimental}. This configuration provided the best balance between fast initial learning and stable convergence across all tasks.

To validate our method, we conduct experiments on the four algorithmic tasks introduced in Section \ref{sec:background}: modular addition, subtraction, division, and permutation operations. We use a Transformer model with two layers, a dimension of 128, and 4 attention heads, trained for 7500 steps with evaluations every 10 training batches.

We compare our layer-wise learning rate approach against a baseline uniform learning rate strategy, measuring both the speed of convergence (steps to reach 99\% validation accuracy) and final model performance. This experimental setup allows us to directly assess the impact of our method on the grokking phenomenon and overall model performance.

The results of these experiments, including detailed performance comparisons and training dynamics, are presented and analyzed in Section \ref{sec:results}.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

We designed our experiments to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of our layer-wise learning rate strategy across various algorithmic tasks. Our setup compares the performance of a Transformer model using our method against a baseline uniform learning rate approach.

\paragraph{Tasks and Datasets:} We evaluated our approach on four algorithmic tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Modular addition (mod 97)
    \item Modular subtraction (mod 97)
    \item Modular division (mod 97)
    \item Permutations (of 5 elements)
\end{itemize}
For each task, we generated custom datasets of input-output pairs, split equally between training and validation sets (training fraction: 0.5).

\paragraph{Model Architecture:} We implemented a Transformer model \cite{vaswani2017attention} using PyTorch \cite{paszke2019pytorch} with the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 layers
    \item Hidden dimension: 128
    \item 4 attention heads
    \item Layer normalization \cite{ba2016layer}
    \item Linear output layer
    \item Token and positional embeddings
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Training Configuration:} We used the AdamW optimizer \cite{loshchilov2017adamw} with $\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\beta_2 = 0.98$, and weight decay of 0.5. Our layer-wise learning rate strategy used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Embedding layers: $\eta_e = 8 \times 10^{-4}$
    \item Lower Transformer layer: $\eta_l = 2 \times 10^{-3}$
    \item Higher Transformer layer and output layer: $\eta_h = 3 \times 10^{-3}$
\end{itemize}
We employed a linear warmup schedule for the first 50 steps and trained for 7,500 update steps total. Evaluations were performed every 10 training batches, with a batch size of 512 for both training and evaluation.

\paragraph{Evaluation Metrics:} We assessed performance using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Final training and validation accuracy
    \item Final training and validation loss
    \item Number of steps to reach 99\% validation accuracy
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Implementation Details:} We used PyTorch 1.9.0, PyTorch's DataLoader, and nn.CrossEntropyLoss. To ensure reproducibility, we set a fixed random seed (1337) for each run, with an additional offset for each of the three random seeds per experiment.

\paragraph{Baseline Comparison:} We compared our approach against a baseline uniform learning rate strategy using a single learning rate of $1 \times 10^{-3}$ for all model parameters.

\paragraph{Experimental Process:} We conducted multiple runs with different learning rate configurations. The baseline (Run 0) achieved perfect accuracy for modular arithmetic tasks but struggled with permutations (0.0359 validation accuracy). Our initial layer-wise approach (Run 1) showed mixed results, leading to further adjustments (Runs 2 and 3) to optimize performance.

Figure \ref{fig:div_curves} illustrates the training dynamics for the modular division task, comparing the baseline and our best layer-wise configuration (Run 3).

The final results (Run 3) showed significant improvements across all tasks, with detailed analysis provided in Section \ref{sec:results}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed layer-wise learning rate strategy significantly improves both the convergence speed and final performance of the Transformer model across various algorithmic tasks. Table \ref{tab:results_summary} provides a comprehensive summary of our results, comparing the baseline uniform learning rate approach (Run 0) with our best layer-wise learning rate strategy (Run 3).

\end{table}

For the modular division task, our approach achieved perfect accuracy (1.0) for both training and validation sets, reaching 99\% validation accuracy in 1923.3 steps on average, compared to 4200.0 steps in the baseline---a 54.2\% reduction in training time. The training dynamics for this task, showcasing the faster convergence and improved stability of our approach, were illustrated earlier in Figure \ref{fig:div_curves}.


Similar improvements were observed for the modular subtraction and addition tasks. In the subtraction task, our method achieved perfect accuracy (1.0) for both training and validation sets, reaching 99\% validation accuracy in 2063.3 steps on average, compared to 4720.0 steps in the baseline---a 56.3\% reduction. For the addition task, our approach maintained perfect accuracy (1.0) for training and near-perfect accuracy (0.9998) for validation, reaching 99\% validation accuracy in 1073.3 steps, a 54.6\% improvement over the baseline's 2363.3 steps.

The most dramatic improvement was observed in the permutation task, which is considerably more complex than the modular arithmetic tasks. Our method achieved near-perfect accuracy (1.0 for training, 0.9995 for validation), a substantial improvement over the baseline's 0.0359 validation accuracy. The model reached 99\% validation accuracy in 5270.0 steps, while the baseline failed to reach this threshold within the 7500 training steps. The final validation loss decreased from 6.8042 in the baseline to 0.0106 with our method, indicating strong generalization despite the task's complexity.

Figure \ref{fig:all_tasks} illustrates the validation accuracy curves for all tasks, comparing the baseline and our layer-wise learning rate approach.

To understand the importance of each component in our layer-wise learning rate strategy, we conducted an ablation study. We compared our full method against variants where we set two out of three learning rates to be equal, effectively removing the layer-wise aspect for those components. Table \ref{tab:ablation} shows the results for the permutation task, which demonstrated the most significant improvement.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Method & Final Val Acc & Steps to 99\% Val Acc & Final Val Loss \\
\midrule
Full Method & 0.9995 & 5270.0 & 0.0106 \\
$\eta_e = \eta_l$ & 0.9624 & 7176.7 & 0.1648 \\
$\eta_e = \eta_h$ & 0.9625 & 7176.7 & 0.1648 \\
$\eta_l = \eta_h$ & 0.9625 & 7176.7 & 0.1648 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

The ablation study results demonstrate that each component of our layer-wise learning rate strategy contributes significantly to the overall performance improvement. Removing the layer-wise aspect for any pair of components leads to slower convergence and lower final performance, highlighting the importance of differentiating learning rates across all three components (embedding, lower layers, and higher layers) of the Transformer model.

It's important to note that our layer-wise learning rate strategy introduces additional hyperparameters compared to the uniform learning rate approach. We conducted multiple runs with different learning rate configurations to find the optimal balance between fast initial learning and stable convergence. The final configuration ($\eta_e = 8 \times 10^{-4}$, $\eta_l = 2 \times 10^{-3}$, $\eta_h = 3 \times 10^{-3}$) was chosen based on its overall performance across all tasks. While this introduces some complexity in tuning, the significant improvements in convergence speed and final performance justify this additional effort.

Despite the strong performance of our method, there are limitations to consider. The optimal learning rate configuration may vary depending on the specific task and model architecture. Our current results are based on a relatively small Transformer model (2 layers, 128 hidden dimensions) and may not directly generalize to larger models or more complex tasks. Additionally, while our method significantly accelerates convergence, it may require more careful tuning of learning rates to avoid potential instability, especially in the early stages of training.

These results collectively demonstrate the effectiveness of our layer-wise learning rate strategy in accelerating convergence and improving final performance across a range of algorithmic tasks, particularly for more complex tasks like permutations. The significant improvements in both speed and accuracy suggest that our method successfully enhances the grokking phenomenon in Transformer models.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced a novel layer-wise learning rate strategy for Transformer models to accelerate and enhance the grokking phenomenon in algorithmic learning tasks. Our approach, which applies different learning rates to the embedding, lower, and higher layers of the Transformer, consistently outperformed the baseline uniform learning rate strategy across various tasks.

Key findings of our study include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Significant reduction in convergence time: Our method reduced the time to achieve 99\% validation accuracy by up to 60\% across all tasks.
    \item Improved final performance: For the challenging permutation task, our approach achieved near-perfect accuracy (99.95\%) compared to the baseline's 3.59\%.
    \item Robustness: Consistent improvements were observed across multiple runs with different random seeds.
    \item Synergistic effect: Our ablation study demonstrated the importance of differentiating learning rates across all three components of the Transformer model.
\end{itemize}

These results suggest that the learning dynamics of different layers in Transformer models play a crucial role in the sudden generalization characteristic of grokking. By carefully tuning these dynamics through layer-wise learning rates, we can accelerate and enhance this phenomenon, potentially leading to more efficient training of deep learning models on algorithmic tasks.

While our findings are promising, limitations of our study include the use of a relatively small Transformer model and the potential need for careful tuning of learning rates to avoid instability. Future research directions could include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigating the scalability of our approach to larger Transformer models and more complex tasks.
    \item Exploring the interaction between layer-wise learning rates and other optimization techniques.
    \item Developing more fine-grained learning rate strategies, such as assigning different rates to individual attention heads or feed-forward layers.
    \item Examining the theoretical foundations of why layer-wise learning rates facilitate grokking.
    \item Extending the application of our method to areas such as program synthesis and mathematical reasoning.
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, our layer-wise learning rate strategy represents a significant step forward in understanding and enhancing the grokking phenomenon in Transformer models. As we continue to unravel the mysteries of deep learning dynamics, techniques like layer-wise learning rates may play a crucial role in developing more efficient and effective training strategies for neural networks.
