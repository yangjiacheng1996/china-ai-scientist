    "Summary": "The paper introduces the Multi-Style Adapter, a method to enhance style awareness and consistency in character-level language models by incorporating learnable style embeddings, a style classification head, and a StyleAdapter module into the GPT architecture. The approach is evaluated on multiple datasets, showing improved style consistency and competitive language modeling performance.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Novel approach to integrating style adaptation into language models.",
        "Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies.",
        "Improved style consistency scores across multiple datasets."
