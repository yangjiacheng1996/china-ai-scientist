*Starting Experiments*
Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and baseline results. I'll    
plan the experiments to implement the Grid-Based Noise Adaptation for Enhanced  
Low-Dimensional Diffusion Models. Here's the list of experiments I propose:     

 1 Run 1: Implement basic grid-based noise adaptation with a 10x10 grid         
 2 Run 2: Experiment with a larger 20x20 grid to see if it improves performance 
 3 Run 3: Implement adaptive grid resolution based on the dataset complexity    
 4 Run 4: Add a regularization term to encourage smoother grid values           

Let's start with Run 1, implementing the basic grid-based noise adaptation with 
a 10x10 grid. I'll make the necessary changes to the experiment.py file.

Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and baseline results. I'll    
plan the experiments to implement the Grid-Based Noise Adaptation for Enhanced  
Low-Dimensional Diffusion Models. Here's the list of experiments I propose:     

 1 Run 1: Implement basic grid-based noise adaptation with a 10x10 grid         
 2 Run 2: Experiment with a larger 20x20 grid to see if it improves performance 
 3 Run 3: Implement adaptive grid resolution based on the dataset complexity    
 4 Run 4: Add a regularization term to encourage smoother grid values           

Let's start with Run 1, implementing the basic grid-based noise adaptation with 
a 10x10 grid. I'll make the necessary changes to the experiment.py file.

These changes implement the grid-based noise adaptation with a 10x10 grid. The  
NoiseScheduler now includes a learnable grid, and the MLPDenoiser takes the     
noise adjustment factor as an additional input. The training loop has been      
modified to include the grid parameters in the optimization process, and we've  
added visualization of the grid at regular intervals during training.           

To run this experiment, use the following command:                              

                                                                                
 python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1                                           
                                                                                

This will implement the basic grid-based noise adaptation and provide results   
for comparison with the baseline. After running this experiment, we can analyze 
the results and decide on the next steps for further improvements or            
experiments.

Applied edit to experiment.py
Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and baseline results. I'll plan the experiments to implement the Grid-Based Noise Adaptation for Enhanced Low-Dimensional Diffusion Models. Here's the list of experiments I propose:

1. Run 1: Implement basic grid-based noise adaptation with a 10x10 grid
2. Run 2: Experiment with a larger 20x20 grid to see if it improves performance
3. Run 3: Implement adaptive grid resolution based on the dataset complexity
4. Run 4: Add a regularization term to encourage smoother grid values

Let's start with Run 1, implementing the basic grid-based noise adaptation with a 10x10 grid. I'll make the necessary changes to the `experiment.py` file.

These changes implement the grid-based noise adaptation with a 10x10 grid. The `NoiseScheduler` now includes a learnable grid, and the `MLPDenoiser` takes the noise adjustment factor as an additional input. The training loop has been modified to include the grid parameters in the optimization process, and we've added visualization of the grid at regular intervals during training.

To run this experiment, use the following command:

```
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

This will implement the basic grid-based noise adaptation and provide results for comparison with the baseline. After running this experiment, we can analyze the results and decide on the next steps for further improvements or experiments.

 ## Run 1: Grid-Based Noise Adaptation (10x10 grid)                             
 Experiment description: Implemented a 10x10 grid-based noise adaptation        
 mechanism. The NoiseScheduler was modified to include a learnable grid of nois 
 adjustment factors. The MLPDenoiser now incorporates these grid-based noise    
 levels in its computations. The training loop was updated to optimize the grid 
 parameters along with the model parameters. The sampling process now uses the  
 grid-based noise levels during inference.

 Analysis:                                                                      
 1. Training time: Increased by approximately 50-100% compared to the baseline, 
 likely due to the additional complexity of optimizing the grid parameters.     
 2. Eval loss: Improved for all datasets, with the most significant improvement 
 for the circle dataset (9.9% decrease) and the least for the line dataset (3.8 
 decrease).                                                                     
 3. Inference time: Slightly increased (by about 3-11%), which is expected due  
 the additional computation for grid-based noise adjustment.                    
 4. KL divergence: Improved for circle (7% decrease) and moons (17.8% decrease) 
 datasets, but slightly worse for dino (6.6% increase) and line (19.6% increase 
 datasets.                                                                      
 5. Grid variance: The new metric shows relatively small values (0.002-0.0035), 
 indicating that the learned noise adjustments are fairly uniform across the    
 grid. This suggests that the model might benefit from a larger grid size or    
 different initialization to capture more spatial variation in noise levels.    
                                                                                
 Overall, the grid-based noise adaptation shows promise, particularly for the   
 circle and moons datasets. The improvements in eval loss across all datasets   
 suggest that the approach has potential. However, the mixed results in KL      
 divergence and the increased computational cost indicate that further refineme 
 may be necessary to fully realize the benefits of this approach.

potentially improving performance across all datasets.

 decrease).                                                                     
 3. Inference time: Slightly increased (by about 3-11%), which is expected due  
 the additional computation for grid-based noise adjustment.                    
 4. KL divergence: Improved for circle (7% decrease) and moons (17.8% decrease) 
 datasets, but slightly worse for dino (6.6% increase) and line (19.6% increase 
 datasets.                                                                      
 5. Grid variance: The new metric shows relatively small values (0.002-0.0035), 
 indicating that the learned noise adjustments are fairly uniform across the    
 grid. This suggests that the model might benefit from a larger grid size or    
 different initialization to capture more spatial variation in noise levels.    
                                                                                
 Overall, the grid-based noise adaptation shows promise, particularly for the   
 circle and moons datasets. The improvements in eval loss across all datasets   
 suggest that the approach has potential. However, the mixed results in KL      
 divergence and the increased computational cost indicate that further refineme 
 may be necessary to fully realize the benefits of this approach.

 ## Run 1: Grid-Based Noise Adaptation (10x10 grid)                             
 Experiment description: Implemented a 10x10 grid-based noise adaptation        
 mechanism. The NoiseScheduler was modified to include a learnable grid of nois 
 adjustment factors. The MLPDenoiser now incorporates these grid-based noise    
 levels in its computations. The training loop was updated to optimize the grid 
 parameters along with the model parameters. The sampling process now uses the  
 grid-based noise levels during inference.

 Analysis:                                                                      
 1. Training time: Decreased compared to Run 1, possibly due to faster          
 convergence with the finer grid.                                               
 2. Eval loss: Slightly increased for circle and moons datasets, but decreased  
 for dino and line datasets compared to Run 1. The changes are minimal,         
 suggesting that the larger grid size didn't significantly impact model         
 performance.                                                                   
 3. Inference time: Remained similar to Run 1, indicating that the increased gr 
 size didn't substantially affect inference speed.                              
 4. KL divergence: Slightly worse for circle and dino datasets, but improved fo 
 line and moons datasets compared to Run 1. The changes are relatively small,   
 suggesting that the larger grid size had a mixed impact on distribution        
 matching.                                                                      
 5. Grid variance: Decreased significantly compared to Run 1 for all datasets.  
 This suggests that the finer grid allowed for more uniform noise adjustments   
 across the space.                                                              
                                                                                
 Overall, the increase in grid size from 10x10 to 20x20 did not lead to         
 substantial improvements in model performance. The decreased grid variance     
 indicates that the model is learning more uniform noise adjustments, which may 
 not be capturing the spatial variations in noise levels as effectively as hope 
 The mixed results in eval loss and KL divergence suggest that simply increasin 
 the grid size may not be sufficient to improve the model's performance         
 significantly.                                                                 
                                                                                
 Next steps: Given that increasing the grid size didn't yield significant       
 improvements, we should consider alternative approaches to enhance the noise   
 adaptation mechanism. Possible directions include:                             
 1. Experimenting with different grid initializations to encourage more diverse 
 noise adjustments.                                                             
 2. Implementing a multi-scale grid approach, combining coarse and fine grids.  
 3. Introducing regularization techniques to encourage more meaningful spatial  
 variations in the noise grid.                                                  
 4. Exploring alternative architectures for incorporating spatial information   
 into the noise adaptation process.

For the next experiment, let's try implementing a multi-scale grid approach.    
We'll use two grids: a coarse 5x5 grid and a fine 20x20 grid. This approach     
might allow the model to capture both large-scale and fine-grained noise        
patterns more effectively.                                                      

Here are the changes we need to make to the experiment.py file:

 ## Run 1: Grid-Based Noise Adaptation (10x10 grid)                             
 Experiment description: Implemented a 10x10 grid-based noise adaptation        
 mechanism. The NoiseScheduler was modified to include a learnable grid of nois 
 adjustment factors. The MLPDenoiser now incorporates these grid-based noise    
 levels in its computations. The training loop was updated to optimize the grid 
 parameters along with the model parameters. The sampling process now uses the  
 grid-based noise levels during inference.

 1. Training time: Increased by approximately 50-100% compared to the baseline, 
 likely due to the additional complexity of optimizing the grid parameters.     
 2. Eval loss: Improved for all datasets, with the most significant improvement 
 for the circle dataset (9.9% decrease) and the least for the line dataset (3.8 
 decrease).                                                                     
 3. Inference time: Slightly increased (by about 3-11%), which is expected due  
 the additional computation for grid-based noise adjustment.                    
 4. KL divergence: Improved for circle (7% decrease) and moons (17.8% decrease) 
 datasets, but slightly worse for dino (6.6% increase) and line (19.6% increase 
 datasets.                                                                      
 5. Grid variance: The new metric shows relatively small values (0.002-0.0035), 
 indicating that the learned noise adjustments are fairly uniform across the    
 grid. This suggests that the model might benefit from a larger grid size or    
 different initialization to capture more spatial variation in noise levels.    
                                                                                
 Overall, the grid-based noise adaptation shows promise, particularly for the   
 circle and moons datasets. The improvements in eval loss across all datasets   
 suggest that the approach has potential. However, the mixed results in KL      
 divergence and the increased computational cost indicate that further refineme 
 may be necessary to fully realize the benefits of this approach.

 ## Run 2: Grid-Based Noise Adaptation (20x20 grid)                             
 Experiment description: Increased the grid size from 10x10 to 20x20 to allow f 
 finer-grained noise adaptation. All other aspects of the experiment remained t 
 same as in Run 1.

 Analysis:                                                                      
 1. Training time: Decreased compared to Run 1, possibly due to faster          
 convergence with the finer grid.                                               
 2. Eval loss: Slightly increased for circle and moons datasets, but decreased  
 for dino and line datasets compared to Run 1. The changes are minimal,         
 suggesting that the larger grid size didn't significantly impact model         
 performance.                                                                   
 3. Inference time: Remained similar to Run 1, indicating that the increased gr 
 size didn't substantially affect inference speed.                              
 4. KL divergence: Slightly worse for circle and dino datasets, but improved fo 
 line and moons datasets compared to Run 1. The changes are relatively small,   
 suggesting that the larger grid size had a mixed impact on distribution        
 matching.                                                                      
 5. Grid variance: Decreased significantly compared to Run 1 for all datasets.  
 This suggests that the finer grid allowed for more uniform noise adjustments   
 across the space.                                                              
                                                                                
 Overall, the increase in grid size from 10x10 to 20x20 did not lead to         
 substantial improvements in model performance. The decreased grid variance     
 indicates that the model is learning more uniform noise adjustments, which may 
 not be capturing the spatial variations in noise levels as effectively as hope 
 The mixed results in eval loss and KL divergence suggest that simply increasin 
 the grid size may not be sufficient to improve the model's performance         
 significantly.                                                                 
                                                                                
 Next steps: Given that increasing the grid size didn't yield significant       
 improvements, we should consider alternative approaches to enhance the noise   
 adaptation mechanism. Possible directions include:                             
 1. Experimenting with different grid initializations to encourage more diverse 
 noise adjustments.                                                             
 2. Implementing a multi-scale grid approach, combining coarse and fine grids.  
 3. Introducing regularization techniques to encourage more meaningful spatial  
 variations in the noise grid.                                                  
 4. Exploring alternative architectures for incorporating spatial information   
 into the noise adaptation process.

For the next experiment, let's try implementing a multi-scale grid approach.    
We'll use two grids: a coarse 5x5 grid and a fine 20x20 grid. This approach     
might allow the model to capture both large-scale and fine-grained noise        
patterns more effectively.                                                      

Here are the changes we need to make to the experiment.py file:

These changes implement a multi-scale grid approach with a coarse 5x5 grid and a
fine 20x20 grid. The noise adjustment is now calculated as the product of the   
coarse and fine grid values. We've also updated the visualization to show both  
grids separately.                                                               

You can now run the experiment with the following command:                      

                                                                                
 python experiment.py --out_dir=run_3                                           
                                                                                

This will execute the experiment with the multi-scale grid approach and save the
results in the run_3 directory.

## Run 1: Grid-Based Noise Adaptation (10x10 grid)
Experiment description: Implemented a 10x10 grid-based noise adaptation mechanism. The NoiseScheduler was modified to include a learnable grid of noise adjustment factors. The MLPDenoiser now incorporates these grid-based noise levels in its computations. The training loop was updated to optimize the grid parameters along with the model parameters. The sampling process now uses the grid-based noise levels during inference.

Analysis:
1. Training time: Increased by approximately 50-100% compared to the baseline, likely due to the additional complexity of optimizing the grid parameters.
2. Eval loss: Improved for all datasets, with the most significant improvement for the circle dataset (9.9% decrease) and the least for the line dataset (3.8% decrease).
3. Inference time: Slightly increased (by about 3-11%), which is expected due to the additional computation for grid-based noise adjustment.
4. KL divergence: Improved for circle (7% decrease) and moons (17.8% decrease) datasets, but slightly worse for dino (6.6% increase) and line (19.6% increase) datasets.
5. Grid variance: The new metric shows relatively small values (0.002-0.0035), indicating that the learned noise adjustments are fairly uniform across the grid. This suggests that the model might benefit from a larger grid size or different initialization to capture more spatial variation in noise levels.

Overall, the grid-based noise adaptation shows promise, particularly for the circle and moons datasets. The improvements in eval loss across all datasets suggest that the approach has potential. However, the mixed results in KL divergence and the increased computational cost indicate that further refinement may be necessary to fully realize the benefits of this approach.

## Run 2: Grid-Based Noise Adaptation (20x20 grid)
Experiment description: Increased the grid size from 10x10 to 20x20 to allow for finer-grained noise adaptation. All other aspects of the experiment remained the same as in Run 1.

Analysis:
1. Training time: Decreased compared to Run 1, possibly due to faster convergence with the finer grid.
2. Eval loss: Slightly increased for circle and moons datasets, but decreased for dino and line datasets compared to Run 1. The changes are minimal, suggesting that the larger grid size didn't significantly impact model performance.
3. Inference time: Remained similar to Run 1, indicating that the increased grid size didn't substantially affect inference speed.
4. KL divergence: Slightly worse for circle and dino datasets, but improved for line and moons datasets compared to Run 1. The changes are relatively small, suggesting that the larger grid size had a mixed impact on distribution matching.
5. Grid variance: Decreased significantly compared to Run 1 for all datasets. This suggests that the finer grid allowed for more uniform noise adjustments across the space.

Overall, the increase in grid size from 10x10 to 20x20 did not lead to substantial improvements in model performance. The decreased grid variance indicates that the model is learning more uniform noise adjustments, which may not be capturing the spatial variations in noise levels as effectively as hoped. The mixed results in eval loss and KL divergence suggest that simply increasing the grid size may not be sufficient to improve the model's performance significantly.

Next steps: Given that increasing the grid size didn't yield significant improvements, we should consider alternative approaches to enhance the noise adaptation mechanism. Possible directions include:
1. Experimenting with different grid initializations to encourage more diverse noise adjustments.
2. Implementing a multi-scale grid approach, combining coarse and fine grids.
3. Introducing regularization techniques to encourage more meaningful spatial variations in the noise grid.
4. Exploring alternative architectures for incorporating spatial information into the noise adaptation process.

For the next experiment, let's try implementing a multi-scale grid approach. We'll use two grids: a coarse 5x5 grid and a fine 20x20 grid. This approach might allow the model to capture both large-scale and fine-grained noise patterns more effectively.

Here are the changes we need to make to the `experiment.py` file:

```

These changes implement a multi-scale grid approach with a coarse 5x5 grid and a fine 20x20 grid. The noise adjustment is now calculated as the product of the coarse and fine grid values. We've also updated the visualization to show both grids separately.

You can now run the experiment with the following command:

```
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_3
```

This will execute the experiment with the multi-scale grid approach and save the results in the `run_3` directory.

 ## Run 3: Multi-scale Grid-Based Noise Adaptation (5x5 coarse grid, 20x20 fine 
 grid)                                                                          
 Experiment description: Implemented a multi-scale grid approach, combining a 5 
 coarse grid with a 20x20 fine grid for noise adaptation. The NoiseScheduler wa 
 modified to include two learnable grids of noise adjustment factors: a coarse  
 grid and a fine grid. The noise adjustment is now calculated as the product of 
 the coarse and fine grid factors. The training process optimizes both grids    
 simultaneously. This approach aims to capture both large-scale and fine-graine 
 spatial variations in noise levels.

 Analysis:                                                                      
 1. Training time: Remained similar to Run 2, indicating that the multi-scale   
 approach did not significantly increase computational complexity.              
 2. Eval loss: Improved for all datasets compared to both Run 1 and Run 2, with 
 substantial improvements for the circle (10.1% decrease from Run 2) and line   
 (19.5% decrease from Run 2) datasets.                                          
 3. Inference time: Slightly increased compared to previous runs, but the       
 difference is negligible.                                                      
 4. KL divergence: Improved for circle (13.1% decrease from Run 2) and moons    
 (41.6% decrease from Run 2) datasets, but slightly worse for dino (7.9% increa 
 from Run 2) and line (60.2% increase from Run 2) datasets.                     
 5. Grid variance: The coarse grid shows higher variance (0.007-0.010) compared 
 to the fine grid (0.0006-0.001), suggesting that the coarse grid is capturing  
 larger-scale spatial variations while the fine grid makes more subtle          
 adjustments.                                                                   
                                                                                
 Overall, the multi-scale grid approach shows promising results, particularly f 
 the circle and moons datasets. The improvements in eval loss across all datase 
 and the significant reductions in KL divergence for circle and moons suggest   
 that this approach is more effective at capturing spatial variations in noise  
 levels compared to the single-grid methods used in previous runs. The higher   
 variance in the coarse grid indicates that it's learning meaningful large-scal 
 patterns, while the fine grid makes more localized adjustments.                
                                                                                
 Next steps:                                                                    
 1. Experiment with different grid sizes for both coarse and fine grids to find 
 the optimal balance.                                                           
 2. Introduce regularization techniques to encourage more diversity in the fine 
 grid adjustments.                                                              
 3. Visualize the learned coarse and fine grids to gain insights into the spati 
 patterns being captured.                                                       
 4. Explore the impact of different initialization strategies for the grids.    
 5. Investigate the performance of the multi-scale approach on more complex     
 datasets or higher-dimensional data.

These changes introduce L1 regularization to the fine grid, which should        
encourage sparsity and potentially lead to more meaningful local adjustments.   
The fine_grid_l1_weight parameter controls the strength of this regularization.

This will execute the experiment with the newly added L1 regularization on the  
fine grid, while keeping all other parameters the same as in the previous run.

Overall, the multi-scale grid approach shows promising results, particularly for the circle and moons datasets. The improvements in eval loss across all datasets and the significant reductions in KL divergence for circle and moons suggest that this approach is more effective at capturing spatial variations in noise levels compared to the single-grid methods used in previous runs. The higher variance in the coarse grid indicates that it's learning meaningful large-scale patterns, while the fine grid makes more localized adjustments.

Next steps:
1. Experiment with different grid sizes for both coarse and fine grids to find the optimal balance.
2. Introduce regularization techniques to encourage more diversity in the fine grid adjustments.
3. Visualize the learned coarse and fine grids to gain insights into the spatial patterns being captured.
4. Explore the impact of different initialization strategies for the grids.
5. Investigate the performance of the multi-scale approach on more complex datasets or higher-dimensional data.

Now, let's implement the next experiment based on the proposed next steps. We'll focus on introducing regularization techniques to encourage more diversity in the fine grid adjustments. Specifically, we'll add L1 regularization to the fine grid to promote sparsity and potentially capture more meaningful local variations.

                loss = mse_loss + config.fine_grid_l1_weight * fine_grid_l1
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes introduce L1 regularization to the fine grid, which should encourage sparsity and potentially lead to more meaningful local adjustments. The `fine_grid_l1_weight` parameter controls the strength of this regularization.

To run the next experiment, use the following command:

```
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_4
```

This will execute the experiment with the newly added L1 regularization on the fine grid, while keeping all other parameters the same as in the previous run.

    - Coarse grid: Showed similar variance levels to Run 3, indicating that the 
 coarse grid continued to capture large-scale patterns.                         
    - Fine grid: Dramatically decreased to near-zero values for all datasets,   
 suggesting that the L1 regularization effectively encouraged sparsity in the   
 fine grid adjustments.                                                         
                                                                                
 Overall, the introduction of L1 regularization on the fine grid led to mixed   
 results across datasets. The approach was particularly effective for the circl 
 and dino datasets, showing improvements in both eval loss and KL divergence. T 
 line dataset saw a significant improvement in KL divergence despite an increas 
 in eval loss. The moons dataset, however, showed slightly worse performance    
 across metrics.                                                                
                                                                                
 The near-zero variance in the fine grid for all datasets indicates that the L1 
 regularization might be too strong, effectively nullifying the fine grid's     
 contribution to the noise adaptation process. This suggests that we may need t 
 adjust the regularization strength or explore alternative approaches to        
 encourage meaningful fine-grained adjustments while preventing overfitting.

 1. Experiment with different L1 regularization weights to find a better balanc 
 between sparsity and fine-grained adjustments.                                 
 2. Consider alternative regularization techniques, such as L2 regularization o 
 a combination of L1 and L2 (elastic net), for the fine grid.

 diverse starting points.

This change reduces the L1 regularization weight by an order of magnitude, which
should allow for more meaningful fine-grained adjustments while still           
encouraging some level of sparsity.

This setup will help us understand if a less aggressive L1 regularization on the
fine grid can lead to better performance across all datasets while still        
maintaining the benefits of the multi-scale approach.

```

This change reduces the L1 regularization weight by an order of magnitude, which should allow for more meaningful fine-grained adjustments while still encouraging some level of sparsity.

We will run the next experiment using the command:
```
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_5
```

This setup will help us understand if a less aggressive L1 regularization on the fine grid can lead to better performance across all datasets while still maintaining the benefits of the multi-scale approach.

Certainly! I'll modify the plot.py file to include the correct labels for each  
run and generate the most relevant plots for the final writeup. Here are the

I understand the issue. The error is occurring because the code is trying to    
access 'run_5' in the labels dictionary, but it doesn't exist. Let's modify the 
plot.py file to only use the runs that are present in the labels dictionary.

This change ensures that we only plot the runs that are both defined in the     
labels dictionary and present in the final_results. This should resolve the     
KeyError you encountered.

KeyError: 'run_5'

Plotting failed with return code 1
I understand the issue. The error is occurring because 'run_5' is not in the    
labels dictionary. Let's modify the plot.py file to handle this situation. We'll
update the code to only plot the runs that are present in both the labels       
dictionary and the final_results. Here's the change:

This change ensures that we only plot the runs that are defined in the labels   
dictionary and present in the final_results. It also regenerates the color      
palette based on the actual number of runs we'll be plotting. This should       
resolve the KeyError you encountered.

I understand the issue. The generate_color_palette function is defined later in 
the file, but it's being called before its definition. Let's move the function  
definition before its usage. Here's the change:

I understand the issue. The error is occurring because we're trying to access

This change does two things:                                                    

 1 It adds "run_5" to the labels dictionary.                                    
 2 It modifies the list comprehension for runs to iterate over                  
   final_results.keys() instead of labels.keys(). This ensures that we only     
   include runs that actually exist in the final_results.                       

These modifications should resolve the KeyError and allow the plotting to       
proceed without errors.

 # Plot Descriptions                                                            
                                                                                
 1. Training Loss (train_loss.png):                                             
    This figure shows the training loss over time for each dataset (circle, din 
 line, and moons) across all runs. The plot consists of four subplots, one for  
 each dataset, arranged in a 2x2 grid. Each subplot displays multiple lines, on 
 for each run, showing how the loss decreases during training. This allows for  
 easy comparison of convergence rates and final loss values between different   
 runs and datasets. The x-axis represents the training steps, while the y-axis  
 shows the loss value. Different colors are used to distinguish between runs,   
 with a legend provided for identification.                                     
                                                                                
 2. Generated Images (generated_images.png):                                    
    This figure visualizes the samples generated by the trained models for each 
 dataset and run. It's organized as a grid, where each row represents a differe 
 run, and each column represents a different dataset (circle, dino, line, and   
 moons). Each subplot is a scatter plot of the generated 2D points, with the x  
 and y axes representing the two dimensions of the data. This allows for a visu 
 comparison of the quality and distribution of generated samples across differe 
 runs and datasets. The color of the points in each subplot corresponds to the  
 color used for that run in other plots, maintaining consistency throughout the 
 analysis.                                                                      
                                                                                
 3. Evaluation Metrics (evaluation_metrics.png):                                
    This figure presents a comparison of various evaluation metrics across all  
 runs and datasets. It consists of four bar plots arranged in a 2x2 grid, each  
 representing a different metric: evaluation loss, KL divergence, training time 
 and inference time. In each subplot, groups of bars represent different        
 datasets, and within each group, individual bars represent different runs. Thi 
 allows for easy comparison of model performance across runs and datasets for   
 each metric. The x-axis labels indicate the datasets, while the y-axis shows t 
 metric value. A legend is provided to identify which bar corresponds to which  
 run.                                                                           
                                                                                
 4. Grid Variance Comparison (grid_variance_comparison.png):                    
    This figure, specific to runs 3 and 4 (Multi-scale Grid and Multi-scale + L 
 Reg), compares the variance in the coarse and fine grids used for noise        
 adaptation. It consists of two bar plots side by side, one for the coarse grid 
 variance and one for the fine grid variance. Each plot shows the variance valu 
 for all four datasets, with bars for both run 3 and run 4 side by side for eas 
 comparison. This visualization helps in understanding how the L1 regularizatio 
 in run 4 affects the learned noise adaptation patterns compared to the         
 non-regularized approach in run 3. The x-axis labels indicate the datasets,    
 while the y-axis shows the variance value.                                     
                                                                                
 5. Noise Adjustment Grids (${dataset_name}_coarse_grid_step_${step_number}.png 
 and ${dataset_name}_fine_grid_step_${step_number}.png):                        
    These figures, generated during the training process, visualize the learned 
 noise adjustment grids at various training steps. For each dataset and at      
 regular intervals during training (every 1000 steps), two heatmaps are         
 generated: one for the coarse grid and one for the fine grid. The heatmaps sho 
 the learned noise adjustment factors across the 2D space, with colors indicati 
 the magnitude of the adjustment. These visualizations provide insights into ho 
 the model learns to adapt noise levels differently across the input space and  
 how these adaptations evolve during training. The coarse grid (5x5) captures   
 large-scale patterns, while the fine grid (20x20) shows more detailed, localiz 
 adjustments.                                                                   
                                                                                
 These plots collectively provide a comprehensive view of the model's           
 performance, the quality of generated samples, and the effectiveness of the    
 grid-based noise adaptation mechanism across different datasets and experiment 
 configurations.                                                                
 >>>>>>> REPLACE                                                                
                                                                                

This modification adds detailed descriptions of each plot, including their      
filenames and what they represent. These descriptions will be valuable for      
someone writing a report on this experiment in the future, as they provide      
context and interpretation for each visualization.
