Description: Baseline results.

## Run 1: Grid-Based Noise Adaptation (10x10 grid)
Experiment description: Implemented a 10x10 grid-based noise adaptation mechanism. The NoiseScheduler was modified to include a learnable grid of noise adjustment factors. The MLPDenoiser now incorporates these grid-based noise levels in its computations. The training loop was updated to optimize the grid parameters along with the model parameters. The sampling process now uses the grid-based noise levels during inference.

Results: {'circle': {'training_time': 72.2452929019928, 'eval_loss': 0.3957345437668169, 'inference_time': 0.19002866744995117, 'kl_divergence': 0.33404137005932666, 'grid_variance': 0.002777667250484228}, 'dino': {'training_time': 70.31516480445862, 'eval_loss': 0.6458895817742019, 'inference_time': 0.18693757057189941, 'kl_divergence': 1.1301831225390124, 'grid_variance': 0.0023937306832522154}, 'line': {'training_time': 76.5330286026001, 'eval_loss': 0.7712131371278592, 'inference_time': 0.18567490577697754, 'kl_divergence': 0.18761912891235336, 'grid_variance': 0.0035206619650125504}, 'moons': {'training_time': 73.73473834991455, 'eval_loss': 0.589565737320639, 'inference_time': 0.19662714004516602, 'kl_divergence': 0.11135187421983446, 'grid_variance': 0.0031416022684425116}}

Analysis:
1. Training time: Increased by approximately 50-100% compared to the baseline, likely due to the additional complexity of optimizing the grid parameters.
2. Eval loss: Improved for all datasets, with the most significant improvement for the circle dataset (9.9% decrease) and the least for the line dataset (3.8% decrease).
3. Inference time: Slightly increased (by about 3-11%), which is expected due to the additional computation for grid-based noise adjustment.
4. KL divergence: Improved for circle (7% decrease) and moons (17.8% decrease) datasets, but slightly worse for dino (6.6% increase) and line (19.6% increase) datasets.
5. Grid variance: The new metric shows relatively small values (0.002-0.0035), indicating that the learned noise adjustments are fairly uniform across the grid. This suggests that the model might benefit from a larger grid size or different initialization to capture more spatial variation in noise levels.

Overall, the grid-based noise adaptation shows promise, particularly for the circle and moons datasets. The improvements in eval loss across all datasets suggest that the approach has potential. However, the mixed results in KL divergence and the increased computational cost indicate that further refinement may be necessary to fully realize the benefits of this approach.

## Run 2: Grid-Based Noise Adaptation (20x20 grid)
Experiment description: Increased the grid size from 10x10 to 20x20 to allow for finer-grained noise adaptation. All other aspects of the experiment remained the same as in Run 1.

Results: {'circle': {'training_time': 61.36747455596924, 'eval_loss': 0.3965786517123737, 'inference_time': 0.1880967617034912, 'kl_divergence': 0.34939379720249025, 'grid_variance': 0.0006894692778587341}, 'dino': {'training_time': 61.40353488922119, 'eval_loss': 0.6446876498439428, 'inference_time': 0.1821444034576416, 'kl_divergence': 1.106597165466926, 'grid_variance': 0.0006851014331914485}, 'line': {'training_time': 57.40531301498413, 'eval_loss': 0.7804632755496618, 'inference_time': 0.17763042449951172, 'kl_divergence': 0.1942168530689934, 'grid_variance': 0.0011169814970344305}, 'moons': {'training_time': 60.078025579452515, 'eval_loss': 0.5984103514257905, 'inference_time': 0.19323015213012695, 'kl_divergence': 0.09598977901828819, 'grid_variance': 0.0008280634065158665}}

Analysis:
1. Training time: Decreased compared to Run 1, possibly due to faster convergence with the finer grid.
2. Eval loss: Slightly increased for circle and moons datasets, but decreased for dino and line datasets compared to Run 1. The changes are minimal, suggesting that the larger grid size didn't significantly impact model performance.
3. Inference time: Remained similar to Run 1, indicating that the increased grid size didn't substantially affect inference speed.
4. KL divergence: Slightly worse for circle and dino datasets, but improved for line and moons datasets compared to Run 1. The changes are relatively small, suggesting that the larger grid size had a mixed impact on distribution matching.
5. Grid variance: Decreased significantly compared to Run 1 for all datasets. This suggests that the finer grid allowed for more uniform noise adjustments across the space.

Overall, the increase in grid size from 10x10 to 20x20 did not lead to substantial improvements in model performance. The decreased grid variance indicates that the model is learning more uniform noise adjustments, which may not be capturing the spatial variations in noise levels as effectively as hoped. The mixed results in eval loss and KL divergence suggest that simply increasing the grid size may not be sufficient to improve the model's performance significantly.

Next steps: Given that increasing the grid size didn't yield significant improvements, we should consider alternative approaches to enhance the noise adaptation mechanism. Possible directions include:
1. Experimenting with different grid initializations to encourage more diverse noise adjustments.
2. Implementing a multi-scale grid approach, combining coarse and fine grids.
3. Introducing regularization techniques to encourage more meaningful spatial variations in the noise grid.
4. Exploring alternative architectures for incorporating spatial information into the noise adaptation process.

## Run 3: Multi-scale Grid-Based Noise Adaptation (5x5 coarse grid, 20x20 fine grid)
Experiment description: Implemented a multi-scale grid approach, combining a 5x5 coarse grid with a 20x20 fine grid for noise adaptation. The NoiseScheduler was modified to include two learnable grids of noise adjustment factors: a coarse grid and a fine grid. The noise adjustment is now calculated as the product of the coarse and fine grid factors. The training process optimizes both grids simultaneously. This approach aims to capture both large-scale and fine-grained spatial variations in noise levels.

Analysis:
1. Training time: Remained similar to Run 2, indicating that the multi-scale approach did not significantly increase computational complexity.
2. Eval loss: Improved for all datasets compared to both Run 1 and Run 2, with substantial improvements for the circle (10.1% decrease from Run 2) and line (19.5% decrease from Run 2) datasets.
3. Inference time: Slightly increased compared to previous runs, but the difference is negligible.
4. KL divergence: Improved for circle (13.1% decrease from Run 2) and moons (41.6% decrease from Run 2) datasets, but slightly worse for dino (7.9% increase from Run 2) and line (60.2% increase from Run 2) datasets.
5. Grid variance: The coarse grid shows higher variance (0.007-0.010) compared to the fine grid (0.0006-0.001), suggesting that the coarse grid is capturing larger-scale spatial variations while the fine grid makes more subtle adjustments.

Overall, the multi-scale grid approach shows promising results, particularly for the circle and moons datasets. The improvements in eval loss across all datasets and the significant reductions in KL divergence for circle and moons suggest that this approach is more effective at capturing spatial variations in noise levels compared to the single-grid methods used in previous runs. The higher variance in the coarse grid indicates that it's learning meaningful large-scale patterns, while the fine grid makes more localized adjustments.

Next steps:
1. Experiment with different grid sizes for both coarse and fine grids to find the optimal balance.
2. Introduce regularization techniques to encourage more diversity in the fine grid adjustments.
3. Visualize the learned coarse and fine grids to gain insights into the spatial patterns being captured.
4. Explore the impact of different initialization strategies for the grids.
5. Investigate the performance of the multi-scale approach on more complex datasets or higher-dimensional data.

## Run 4: Multi-scale Grid-Based Noise Adaptation with L1 Regularization on Fine Grid
Experiment description: Building upon the multi-scale grid approach from Run 3, we introduced L1 regularization on the fine grid to encourage sparsity and prevent overfitting. The experiment used a 5x5 coarse grid and a 20x20 fine grid, with an L1 regularization weight of 0.01 applied to the fine grid. This approach aims to allow the coarse grid to capture large-scale patterns while encouraging the fine grid to make only necessary, localized adjustments.

Results: {'circle': {'training_time': 76.58001351356506, 'eval_loss': 0.38757572839479615, 'inference_time': 0.2047441005706787, 'kl_divergence': 0.3233448326820488, 'coarse_grid_variance': 0.010761231184005737, 'fine_grid_variance': 2.2071786016205546e-17}, 'dino': {'training_time': 77.1138973236084, 'eval_loss': 0.6413314583356423, 'inference_time': 0.19238519668579102, 'kl_divergence': 1.166831156285635, 'coarse_grid_variance': 0.0075126830488443375, 'fine_grid_variance': 7.105605021934508e-19}, 'line': {'training_time': 81.69518947601318, 'eval_loss': 0.765471396086466, 'inference_time': 0.19542980194091797, 'kl_divergence': 0.19653485066494875, 'coarse_grid_variance': 0.008399258367717266, 'fine_grid_variance': 0.0}, 'moons': {'training_time': 81.41889429092407, 'eval_loss': 0.585447847919391, 'inference_time': 0.19643688201904297, 'kl_divergence': 0.10539839714111231, 'coarse_grid_variance': 0.01050220150500536, 'fine_grid_variance': 1.0836047826471186e-17}}

Analysis:
1. Training time: Slightly increased compared to Run 3, likely due to the additional L1 regularization computation.
2. Eval loss: Improved for circle (8.7% decrease) and dino (2.7% decrease) datasets, but slightly worse for line (21.8% increase) and moons (4.6% increase) datasets compared to Run 3.
3. Inference time: Remained similar to Run 3, indicating that the L1 regularization didn't significantly affect inference speed.
4. KL divergence: Improved for circle (6.4% decrease), dino (2.3% decrease), and line (36.8% decrease) datasets, but slightly worse for moons (9.8% increase) dataset compared to Run 3.
5. Grid variance: 
   - Coarse grid: Showed similar variance levels to Run 3, indicating that the coarse grid continued to capture large-scale patterns.
   - Fine grid: Dramatically decreased to near-zero values for all datasets, suggesting that the L1 regularization effectively encouraged sparsity in the fine grid adjustments.

Overall, the introduction of L1 regularization on the fine grid led to mixed results across datasets. The approach was particularly effective for the circle and dino datasets, showing improvements in both eval loss and KL divergence. The line dataset saw a significant improvement in KL divergence despite an increase in eval loss. The moons dataset, however, showed slightly worse performance across metrics.

The near-zero variance in the fine grid for all datasets indicates that the L1 regularization might be too strong, effectively nullifying the fine grid's contribution to the noise adaptation process. This suggests that we may need to adjust the regularization strength or explore alternative approaches to encourage meaningful fine-grained adjustments while preventing overfitting.

Next steps:
1. Experiment with different L1 regularization weights to find a better balance between sparsity and fine-grained adjustments.
2. Consider alternative regularization techniques, such as L2 regularization or a combination of L1 and L2 (elastic net), for the fine grid.
3. Explore different initialization strategies for the grids to encourage more diverse starting points.
4. Investigate the use of attention mechanisms or other techniques to dynamically adjust the contribution of the fine grid based on the input data.
5. Analyze the learned coarse grid patterns to gain insights into the spatial variations captured by the model.

# Plot Descriptions

1. Training Loss (train_loss.png):
   This figure shows the training loss over time for each dataset (circle, dino, line, and moons) across all runs. The plot consists of four subplots, one for each dataset, arranged in a 2x2 grid. Each subplot displays multiple lines, one for each run, showing how the loss decreases during training. This allows for easy comparison of convergence rates and final loss values between different runs and datasets. The x-axis represents the training steps, while the y-axis shows the loss value. Different colors are used to distinguish between runs, with a legend provided for identification.

2. Generated Images (generated_images.png):
   This figure visualizes the samples generated by the trained models for each dataset and run. It's organized as a grid, where each row represents a different run, and each column represents a different dataset (circle, dino, line, and moons). Each subplot is a scatter plot of the generated 2D points, with the x and y axes representing the two dimensions of the data. This allows for a visual comparison of the quality and distribution of generated samples across different runs and datasets. The color of the points in each subplot corresponds to the color used for that run in other plots, maintaining consistency throughout the analysis.

3. Evaluation Metrics (evaluation_metrics.png):
   This figure presents a comparison of various evaluation metrics across all runs and datasets. It consists of four bar plots arranged in a 2x2 grid, each representing a different metric: evaluation loss, KL divergence, training time, and inference time. In each subplot, groups of bars represent different datasets, and within each group, individual bars represent different runs. This allows for easy comparison of model performance across runs and datasets for each metric. The x-axis labels indicate the datasets, while the y-axis shows the metric value. A legend is provided to identify which bar corresponds to which run.

4. Grid Variance Comparison (grid_variance_comparison.png):
   This figure, specific to runs 3 and 4 (Multi-scale Grid and Multi-scale + L1 Reg), compares the variance in the coarse and fine grids used for noise adaptation. It consists of two bar plots side by side, one for the coarse grid variance and one for the fine grid variance. Each plot shows the variance values for all four datasets, with bars for both run 3 and run 4 side by side for easy comparison. This visualization helps in understanding how the L1 regularization in run 4 affects the learned noise adaptation patterns compared to the non-regularized approach in run 3. The x-axis labels indicate the datasets, while the y-axis shows the variance value.

5. Noise Adjustment Grids (${dataset_name}_coarse_grid_step_${step_number}.png and ${dataset_name}_fine_grid_step_${step_number}.png):
   These figures, generated during the training process, visualize the learned noise adjustment grids at various training steps. For each dataset and at regular intervals during training (every 1000 steps), two heatmaps are generated: one for the coarse grid and one for the fine grid. The heatmaps show the learned noise adjustment factors across the 2D space, with colors indicating the magnitude of the adjustment. These visualizations provide insights into how the model learns to adapt noise levels differently across the input space and how these adaptations evolve during training. The coarse grid (5x5) captures large-scale patterns, while the fine grid (20x20) shows more detailed, localized adjustments.

These plots collectively provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance, the quality of generated samples, and the effectiveness of the grid-based noise adaptation mechanism across different datasets and experimental configurations.
