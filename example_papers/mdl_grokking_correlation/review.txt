    "Summary": "The paper investigates the relationship between Minimal Description Length (MDL) and the phenomenon of grokking in neural networks. It introduces a novel MDL estimation technique based on weight pruning and applies it to modular arithmetic and permutation tasks. The findings suggest a strong correlation between MDL reduction and improved generalization, particularly in grokking scenarios.",
