ABSTRACT

In this paper, we present a novel approach to learn texture mapping for a 3D surface and apply it to document image unwarping. We propose an efficient method
to learn surface parameterization by learning a continuous bijective mapping between 3D surface positions and 2D texture-space coordinates. Our surface parameterization network can be conveniently plugged into a differentiable rendering
pipeline and trained using multi-view images and rendering loss. Recent work on
differentiable rendering techniques for implicit surfaces has shown high-quality
3D scene reconstruction and view synthesis results. However, these methods typically learn the appearance color as a function of the surface points and lack explicit
surface parameterization. Thus they do not allow texture map extraction or texture
editing. By introducing explicit surface parameterization and learning with a recent differentiable renderer for implicit surfaces, we demonstrate state-of-the-art
document-unwarping via texture extraction. We show that our approach can reconstruct high-frequency textures for arbitrary document shapes in both synthetic
and real scenarios. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our system by applying
it to document texture editing.

1 INTRODUCTION

Reconstructing 3D shapes from images is a core problem in computer vision and graphics research.
With the progress in differentiable rendering (Sitzmann et al., 2019b; Kato et al., 2018; Niemeyer
et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019b), recent learning-based 3D reconstruction approaches
have achieved impressive results using 2D supervision from single image (Chen & Zhang, 2019;
Groueix et al., 2018; Choy et al., 2016; Mescheder et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018) or multi-view
images (Tang & Tan, 2018; Yariv et al., 2020). These methods achieve high quality 3D reconstruction using differentiable rendering with various 3D representations such as 3D mesh (Wang et al.,
2018), volumetric representation (Mildenhall et al., 2020), or implicit functions (Mescheder et al.,
2019). In recent neural rendering methods such as NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020) and IDR (Yariv
et al., 2020), continuous representations such as volume or implicit functions achieve significantly
better reconstruction results than meshes or voxels because they do not discretize the 3D surface a
priori. However, these continuous representations usually do not encode explicit surface parameterization, allowing 3D shape re-texturing, editing the existing texture in the 2D texture space, or
recovering 2D texture from 3D surfaces. One of the most direct applications of 2D texture recovery in a geometrically constrained manner, is document unwarping, i.e., inference of a document’s
flatbed-scanned version from a casual photo of a potentially creased document. Whereas 2D texture recovery could be equally valuable for other domains such as garments, or faces, the existing
datasets are not directly applicable to our method.

Our novel texture mapping approach learns surface parameterization for document unwarping by
learning continuous bijective functions between 3D surface positions and 2D texture-space coordinates. We use a signed distance function (SDF) (Chan & Zhu, 2005) to represent geometry and
model the appearance as a function of the 2D texture coordinates. By utilizing implicit differentiable
rendering (IDR), (Yariv et al., 2020) we can reconstruct 3D shape and learn the corresponding UV
parameterization of the surface simultaneously using a per-pixel rendering loss and appropriate geometric regularizations.

We utilize two fully connected multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a bijective mapping between 3D shapes and 2D texture space. More specifically, the forward MLP maps the 3D surface

coordinates to 2D texture coordinates and the backward MLP maps the 2D texture coordinates to
corresponding 3D surface coordinates. Following IDR (Yariv et al., 2020), we obtain the 3D surface
coordinates by sphere-tracing along the ray, cast through each pixel. Our appearance rendering is
formulated as a function of the 3D and the texture coordinates. Therefore, the forward and backward
MLPs can be trained with a 2D pixel-wise loss between the rendered image and the given ground
truth image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first neural rendering method that can learn
effective UV parameterization for implicit surfaces.

As a corollary, our method is also the first method which utilizes implicit surface based neural
rendering for document unwarping. It is a challenging task due to the presence of geometric and
photometric distortions in the document. For this particular problem we introduce a prior for shapespecific texture mapping to initialize the forward MLP (3D to 2D mapping). This prior is learned
from a large dataset of UV mapped document meshes, assuming that document texture space maps
to a 2D equiangular quadrilateral. This assumption regularizes the forward MLP to output a highquality texture space that avoids degenerate solutions (see Fig. 3). Moreover, we introduce a conformality constraint in the backward MLP, which is consistent with how paper folds happen in the
physical world, i.e., without any stretch or tear. This constraint also ensures that the backward
function is bijective and smooth (Petrini et al., 2018).

The main contributions of our paper are the following: First, we propose an efficient way to learn
texture parameterization for implicit neural representations using a differentiable rendering framework. Without 3D supervision, it only requires multi-view images as ground-truth and a texture
mapping prior. Second, we show that our method can be effectively used for document unwarping
tasks by learning a prior for explicit texture mapping on the document shape. We show that this
prior can be learned from a dataset of texture-mapped meshes. Third, we show that our method is
effective for document image unwarping and texture editing (see Fig. 1). We achieve a 52% relative
improvement over the publicly available state-of-the-art[1] (Das et al., 2019) in terms of mean local
distortion across 500 views from ten synthetic scenes. Additionally, we achieve a ∼25% improvement in optical character recognition (OCR) in terms of character and word error rate.

**Neural Rendering. Neural rendering generates images and videos by integrating conventional com-**
puter graphics rendering pipelines into deep neural networks (Tewari et al., 2020). It enables explicit
or implicit control of scene properties, including illumination, geometry, texture, etc. Neural rendering can synthesize semantic photos (Park et al., 2019b; Bau et al., 2019), novel views (Hedman et al.,
2018; Sitzmann et al., 2019a), relighting (Xu et al., 2018; Meka et al., 2019), facial/body reenactment (Chan et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2019), estimate scene properties etc. Kato (Kato et al., 2018)
proposed a differentiable neural renderer using an approximate gradient for rasterization. Liu (Liu
et al., 2019a) proposed SoftRas, which extended differentiable rasterization. Li (Li et al., 2018)
further demonstrated the feasibility of integrating ray-tracing in deep neural networks. More recently, implicit surface or volume rendering has become mainstream in neural rendering approaches
such as IDR (Yariv et al., 2020) and NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020). These approaches are based

on multi-view surface reconstruction to associate the scene geometry to the appearance in different
views. NeRF is extended to lot of variants including PixelNeRF (Yu et al., 2020), MVSNeRF (Chen
et al., 2021), dynamic NeRF (Li et al., 2020; Pumarola et al., 2020), GRAF (Schwarz et al., 2020)
and so on.

**Texture Mapping. Texture mapping is an essential step in the computer graphics rendering pipeline.**
It defines a correspondence between a vertex on the 3D mesh and a pixel in the 2D texture image.
To find such a mapping, FlexiStickers (Tzur & Tal, 2009) required users to specify a sparse set of
correspondences. Bi (Bi et al., 2017) proposed a patch-based texture mapping method using the
3D shape and images from multiple views. Morreale (Morreale et al., 2021) used networks to represent 3D surfaces/shapes. Besides the above general texture mapping methods, some approaches
focus on a specific object categories such as faces (Deng et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019) and human
bodies (Mir et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020). Recently, AtlasNet (Groueix et al., 2018) represented
a 3D mesh as a collection of parametric surfaces; thus, texture mapping is trivial to obtain from a
2D parametric surface. A similar idea was adopted by Bednarik (Bednarik et al., 2020) where they
introduced geometric constraints when learning the decomposition. More recently NeuTex (Xiang
et al., 2021) aims to recover the texture of a subject using NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020). However, NeuTex uses a spherical UV domain without any geometric constraints. Therefore, it is not
suitable for document unwarping. Moreover, since NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020) doesn’t learn
an explicit geometry, NeuTex requires a coarse point-cloud to initialize the backward MLP. With
an SDF based (Yariv et al., 2020) approach, our approach does not require such an initialization
routine. We jointly learn the texture mapping and the geometry from scratch.

**Document Unwarping. Document unwarping is a special application of texture mapping: the**
3D object is usually a rectangular piecewise-developable surface, and the texture is well-structured,
containing straight text lines, (usually) rectangular text blocks and figures, etc. Previous work usually
adopted a two-step methodology: 1) 3D surface estimation and 2) deformed surface flattening. The
3D surface of a deformed document can be estimated from shading (Wada et al., 1997), multi-view
images (Ulges et al., 2004), text lines (Tian & Narasimhan, 2011), local character orientations (Meng
et al., 2018), document boundaries (Koo et al., 2009), and learning-based strategies (Pumarola et al.,
2018). Flattening the obtained 3D surface always involves an expensive optimization process under
certain geometry constraints such as conformality (You et al., 2017) or isometries (Bartoli et al.,
2015). Flattening could be easier if the obtained 3D shape had a low dimensional parameterization
like Generalized Cylindrical Surface (GCS) (Kil et al., 2017). Some studies (Das et al., 2017; Liang
et al., 2008; Meng et al., 2015) proposed to unwarp each patch on the surface individually and then
stitch the unwarped patches together. In recent years, data-driven methods (Ma et al., 2018; Das
et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Markovitz et al., 2020; Das et al., 2021) have addressed document
unwarping by leveraging large-scale synthetic datasets. These datasets contain deformed document
images and their corresponding ground-truth UV coordinates. Methods trained on synthetic images
often suffer from generalization performance due to the domain gap between synthetic and real
data. In this paper, we utilize neural rendering techniques to learn a surface parameterization of a
deformed document. We simultaneously estimate both 3D shapes and UV coordinates with a cycle
consistency loss and geometric constraints. By leveraging the information from multi-view images,
the proposed method demonstrates better document unwarping performance compared to a previous
state-of-the-art, Das et al. (2019).

3 METHOD

A schematic diagram of the proposed approach is shown in Fig. 2. We utilize a recent differentiable rendering method, IDR (Yariv et al., 2020) for surface reconstruction and jointly learn the
texture mapping of the learned implicit surface using two MLPs. In Sec. 3.1 we first describe some
preliminaries about surface parameterization and IDR.

3.1 PRELIMINARIES

**Surface Parameterization. The problem of surface parameterization focuses on finding a bijective**
mapping F between a surface Z ∈ R[3] and a polygonal domain Ω _∈_ R[n]. For a parametric or discrete
surface representation, we can explicitly compute this mapping (Tzur & Tal, 2009) using constrained
optimization. In contrast, implicit surfaces are represented as continuous functions and cannot be
readily parameterized. In this paper, we propose to learn such bijective mapping between a learned

(Fz): Given camera pose τ, and a pixel p we jointly learn the geometry represented by a SDF Zθ, the

et al., 2020), and Cp is the predicted RGB color. Triangles denote the losses defined in Eq. 12.

implicit surface and a 2D planar domain Ω _∈_ R[2] using our proposed forward and backward MLPs.
Ω is the texture space or UV space, parameterized using 2D UV coordinates t = (u, v). We can use
any continuous parameterization function as the UV space. Since this work particularly focuses on
document unwarping, we choose the UV space to be a regular 2D grid.

**Implicit Differentiable Rendering. Implicit Differentiable Rendering (Yariv et al., 2020) recon-**
structs the geometry of an object from multi-view images as the zero level set, Zθ of an MLP S,
_Zθ = {z ∈_ R[3] _| S(z; θ) = 0}_ (1)
where θ are the learnable parameters. To render the surface Zθ, IDR uses another MLP to model
the radiance (RGB color) as a function of the surface point (zp), corresponding surface normal (np),
view direction (vp) and a global geometry feature vector (gp):

_Cp = A(zp, np, vp, gp)_ (2)
Here, Cp denote the predicted color at pixel p and A denotes the appearance MLP. The surface point
is obtained by a sphere-tracing method (Hart, 1996) along the ray rp(τ ) through pixel p. τ ∈ R[k]
denotes camera parameters of the scene. Additionally, IDR also presents a differentiable way to
obtain a ray and geometry intersection point (ˆzp) as a function of the camera ray. Although,the IDR
can disentangle geometry and appearance, it only allows to re-texture a new geometry with a learned
appearance MLP, A. Editing a texture or extracting a surface texture map is not possible in a vanilla
IDR framework since no explicit texture mapping is learned.

3.2 LEARNING SURFACE PARAMETERIZATION
To learn a meaningful parameterization of the implicit surface Zθ, we represent the radiance at pixel
_p as a function of the UV space. To this end, we modify the IDR model (Eq. 2):_
_Cp = Auv(tp, zp, np, vp, gp)_ (3)
The texture parameterized appearance MLP is modeled as a function of the texture coordinate tp
at surface point zp, corresponding to a pixel p. We can jointly train the surface MLP (S) and texture parameterized appearance MLP (Auv) using a pixel wise rendering loss between the predicted
radiance (Cp) and ground-truth radiance (Cp[gt][) at pixel][ p][.]

**Forward and backward texture parameterization. We represent the mapping between the 3D**
surface and 2D texture space using the forward function Fuv:
**z →** **t.** (4)
The Fuv is modeled as an MLP. It is trained by mapping a ray-surface intersection point ˆzp to its
corresponding texture coordinate tp corresponding to a pixel p. Now to establish the bijective mapping (discussed in Sec. 3.1) between the surface and texture space we utilize a backward function
_Fz:_
**t →** **z.** (5)
_Fz is an MLP that learns an inverse mapping between the texture and the 3D space. It is trained by_
mapping a texture coordinate tp to its corresponding ray-surface intersection point ˆzp.

**Shape specific prior for Fuv. Jointly training the forward, backward and rendering network leads**


-----

to the wrong UV mapping with local minima (see Fig. 3)
where multiple ˆzp map to a single texture coordinate. To avoid
such degenerate cases, we initialize Fuv with a texture mapping prior, learned from a large dataset of UV mapped meshes.
This learned prior (F[ˆ]uv) makes the learned texture mapping
suitable for document unwarping. We assume the document
shape to be a deformed quadrilateral and the corresponding
UV space to be a regular grid (∈ [0.0, 1.0]). The top leftmost
and the bottom rightmost 3D coordinate of the shape maps to
(u, v) = (0, 0) and (u, v) = (1, 1) respectively. To learn _F[ˆ]uv_
we utilize a collection of UV mapped document meshes from
the Doc3D (Das et al., 2019) dataset and train an MLP with
the same parameters as Fuv. For each scene, we use _F[ˆ]uv to_
initialize the weights of Fuv and train jointly with S and Auv.


With UV prior Without UV prior

Figure 3: Without a prior the forward network, Fuv leads to degenerate cases: multiple 3D points, ˆzp
are mapped to the same texture coordinate tp.


**Deformation constraints for Fz.** Conformal map (Haker et al., 2000) allows a 3D
domain to be mapped to a texture domain with low distortion satisfying the bijective property between domains. We use a conformality constraint for Fz to ensure
the deformation properties mentioned above. We define the conformality constraint in
terms of the metric tensor, **J[⊤]J of the Fz,** where J is the jacobian of Fz (Eq. 6):


_δFz_ _δFz_
**J =**

_δu_ _δv_

= [Du Dv] **J[⊤]J =** _Du⊤[D][u]_ _Du[⊤][D][v]_
_Du[⊤][D][v]_ _Dv[⊤][D][v]_



_E_
_F_



(6)


The conformality constraint is defined as J[⊤]J = βI. Here β is a unknown local scaling function
and I is the identity matrix. For developable surfaces which can be physically flattened without any
stretch e.g. papers, β doesn’t vary across the parameterization space. Therefore, we consider a fixed
global scale ([βu[g][, β]v[g][]][) for the conformality constraint.]

**Unwarping by sampling Fz. To unwarp an input image, we determine the pixel at p = (x, y) in**
the input image should be projected to (u, v) in the unwarped image. Here the unwarped image
refers to the texture space. The coordinates (u, v) and p are associated by Fz and τ : For a (u, v)
coordinate, its corresponding point in 3D is obtained by ˆzp[′] [=][ F][z][(][u, v][)][. Given the camera parameter]
_τ_, ˆzp[′] [is projected to][ p][ in the input image. Thus for each pixel in the unwarped image, we can find]
its corresponding pixel in the input image which is all we need for unwarping.

3.3 LOSS FUNCTIONS

We use the rendering losses on the predicted color, Cp, and predicted document mask Mp at pixel
by the shape or not (p to train the geometryM Sp = 0. Here). We assume masks are provided as input. Additionally, we employ Mp ∈{0, 1} refers to whether the pixel p is occupied (Mp = 1)
appropriate regularization losses to jointly train S, Auv, Fuv and Fz.

**Loss for S. Following IDR (Yariv et al., 2020), for each p we apply a sphere tracing (Hart, 1996)**
algorithm to find the intersection point of the ray rp(τ ) and the surface Zθ. Given the ground-truth
RGB color Cp[gt] [and the predicted RGB color][ C][p][, the RGB loss is defined as:]

_Lrgb =_ _|P_ _|_ _pX∈Pin_ _Cp[gt]_ _[−]_ _[C][p]_ 1 (7)

Where P is the set of pixels in the minibatch. The pixels Pin _P for which ray surface intersection_
has been found and Mp = 1. The mask loss is defined as: _⊂_

Here Pout = P \ _Pin, alpha is a tunable parameter and CE(.) is the cross-entropy loss. The value of_
_Mp = Mp,α(θ, τ_ ) is a differentiable function of the learned Zθ (Yariv et al., 2020). Additionally, to
force Zθ to be a approximate signed distance function we use Eikonal Regularization (Gropp et al.,


-----

2020):
_Lek = Ez(∥∇zS(z; θ)∥−_ 1)[2] (9)
where z denotes uniformly sampled points within a bounding box of the 3D domain.

**Loss for Fuv. Although we initialize Fuv with learned prior parameters, we constrain the predicted**
2D texture coordinates during training in order to avoid non-uniform mapping of the 3D and the UV
domain which can squeeze or stretch the warped texture (example in supplementary). We employ
a Chamfer distance between the tp and uniformly sampled 2D points T ∈ [0, 1] to ensure Fuv
approximately outputs U ∼ [0, 1]. This regularization term is defined as:
_Luv = CDp_ _Pin_ ( _, tp)_ (10)
_∈_ _T_
here CD(.) denotes the Chamfer distance and tp the predicted texture coordinates corresponding to
ray-surface intersection points ˆzp.

_wp is a pre-calculated per-pixel weight based on the document mask (M_ ) which assigns higher value
to the pixels at the boundary of the document. (More weight calculation details in Supplementary).

Additionally, to constrain Fz to be a fixed scale conformal mapping (Bednarik et al., 2020). We
employ three constraints on the elements of the metric tensor E, F and G defined in Eq. 6.

3.4 TRAINING DETAILS
The surface MLP S(z, θ) consists of 8 layers with a hidden layer dimension of 128, with a skip
connection to the middle layer (Park et al., 2019a). Following IDR (Yariv et al., 2020), S is initialized to produce an approximate SDF of a unit sphere. The rendering network Auv has 4 layers
with hidden layer dimension of 512 and uses a sine activation function (Sitzmann et al., 2020) at
each layer. Fuv and Fz share identical architecture with 8 layers with 512 dimensional hidden units
and sine activation (Sitzmann et al., 2020). Following NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020), we use a k
dimensional Fourier mapping (χk : R → R[2][k]) to learn high frequency details in the shape, RGB
and the UV space. For S, Auv we follow the setting of (Yariv et al., 2020), and set k = 6 and k = 4
respectively. For Fuv and Fz we empirically set number of Fourier bands k = 10. We start with an
initial learning rate of 1e×[−][5] and train for 150K iterations by halving the learning rate after every
50K iterations. Initially, α is set to 50 and doubled during the training after every 50K iterations. We
set γ1 = 100.0, γ2 = 0.1 and ρ = 0.001. δ1 is set to 0.001 for the initial 30K iterations. Afterward,
_δ1 is multiplied by a factor 2 at every 10K iterations for a maximum of 7 times. δ2, δ3 and δ4, are set_
to zero for the initial 100K iterations. Only Lz is sufficient to achieve a good texture to 3D mapping
during the shape optimization phase. Afterwards we set δ2 = δ3 = 0.001 and δ4 = 0.01. The metric
tensor calculation is implemented using auto-differentiation.

4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

First, we quantitatively compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art document unwarping
method DewarpNet (Das et al., 2019). Our quantitative and qualitative experiments are performed
on 10 synthetic scenes and 10 real scenes. Second, we apply our method to texture editing. Last, we
conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed loss functions.

4.1 EVALUATION DATASET AND METRICS

Our synthetic evaluation data consists of 10 scenes rendered using Blender following a rendering
pipeline similar to Doc3D. Each scene consists of 50 random views sampled from a 45[o] solid angle in the upper hemisphere. The real-world evaluation data consists of 3 scenes from the dataset
of (You et al., 2017), and 9 scenes captured by us. Each scene consists of 5-20 images per scene.
We manually annotate the masks for each scene. To obtain camera poses for the real-world data,
we utilize the COLMAP (Sch¨onberger & Frahm, 2016) multi-view reconstruction pipeline. Both
synthetic and real data include the document scan, as the unwarping ground-truth.

We use image-based evaluation metrics for quantitative evaluation, including Local Distortion (LD)
and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM). These are standard metrics used for document
unwarping evaluation (Das et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2018). LD is based on dense SIFT flow (Liu et al.,
2011) between the unwarped and scanned images. Image similarity metric, MS-SSIM (Wang et al.,
2003) is based on local image statistics (mean and variance) of the unwarped and scanned (groundtruth) images calculated over multiple Gaussian pyramid scales. We use the same settings as (Das
et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2018) for fair comparison.

We also report in a stricter evaluation scenario (best view column of Table 1) where we compare
our results with the best possible numerical results achieved by DewarpNet from a single view in

competitive results compared to DewarpNet with a oracle (practically challenging) view selector.The

scores do not accurately reflect the improvement due to the sensitivity of LD and MSSIM to subtle
perceptually unimportant global transformations, such as translation of the image by few pixels.
However, such transformations do not affect the visual quality or readability of the unwarped results.
More discussion and qualitative comparison is available in supplementary material.

The quantitative comparison for real scenes are reported in Table 1 (bottom). We achieve better
results in terms of mean and best evaluation score than DewarpNet in 2 out of 3 scenes. We notice
that the evaluation results are a little worse for the real scenes than synthetic scenes due to the
fewer available views (5-10 compared to 50). Moreover, there are cases like Real 6, which do not
have sufficient texture. Such data are a failure case of IDR since there is insufficient information to
reconstruct the 3D shape. As a result of the poor 3D shape, our texture parameterization network
produces an inferior unwarping result (More details are available in Supplementary). We also report
qualitative comparisons with You et al. (2017) and Das et al. (2019) on additional real documents in
supplementary.

**OCR Evaluation. We also evaluated the OCR performance on 5 real scenes across 77 images in**
Table 2. We use Edit Distance (ED) (Miller et al., 2009), Character Error Rate (CER) and Word
Error Rate (WER) as our evaluation metrics. ED is defined as the total number of substitutions (s),
insertions (i) and deletions (d) required to obtain the reference text, given the recognized text. The
reference text is obtained by running the OCR algorithm on the scanned ground-truth image of each
document. CER is defined as: (s + i + d)/N where N is the number of characters in the reference
text. We use Tesseract 4.1.1 based LSTM OCR engine for this experiment. Our unwarped results
reduce the ED, CER and WER by ∼25%. This improvement proves our unwarped results are more
suitable for downstream applications tasks like OCR.

that yields the best LD with DewarpNet. Proposed results are clearly better, however this improvement is not captured by LD. Follow the blue dashed boxes for discrimitative regions.

**Texture Editing. In addition to document unwarping, our proposed forward and backward MLP**
can also be used for high quality texture editing. We show two texture editing examples in Fig. 1.
We use the backward MLP to unwarp the texture from the input image, then we edit the texture and
warp it back to image space using the learned forward MLP. (More details in Supplementary).

**Ablation Study. We ablate how loss terms Lz, LE, LF, and LG affect the unwarping results. We**
train Fuv and Fz with different combinations of these loss terms and report the mean MSSIM and
LD in Table 3 (appendix). Qualitative results for one scene are shown in Fig. 6 (appendix).

5 TRAINING TIME, GENERALIZABILITY AND FUTURE WORK

Our proposed method for a scene can be trained in approximately 18 hours for 448 × 448 resolution
images using a single Titan Xp GPU. The current training time per scene is very high compared to
DewarpNet’s inference time which makes it unsuitable for real time applications. However, this is a
fast growing field and there are multiple other works that are focusing on improving the speed and
generalization abilities (Garbin et al., 2021; Bergman et al., 2021) of neural rendering. Therefore,
obtaining a faster training scheme is considered as a future work.

Our method can be applied to fabrics, which are very similar to papers and lead to practical applications of texture editing. However, none of the current 3D garment/fabric datasets (Patel et al.,
2020) can be easily adapted to train the _F[ˆ]uv prior. For more complex UV spaces (e.g., texture atlas),_
learning the prior may require decomposing the shape to multiple simple UV maps. The proper way
to do this is beyond the scope of this paper, however we believe it’s an exciting future work. As
importantly, in this paper, we have introduced a number of domain specific strong constraints that
suit the rectangular paper shape. These constraints improve empirical results. More general objects
will require different constraints e.g., spherical UV domain, local scaling of the conformal map etc.

6 CONCLUSIONS

We have introduced an end-to-end trainable architecture that can simultaneously learn texture parameterized 3D shapes from multi-view images. This is the first work to learn surface parameterization of an implicit neural representation to the best of our knowledge. We have demonstrated the
applicability of our approach on multiple synthetic and real scenes for the task of document unwarping and document texture editing. We want to extend this method to learn surface parameterization
for more complex shapes such as faces or general 3D objects in future work.

Texture editing application of our proposed approach can have both positive and negative societal
impact. On the positive side, real document images can be gracefully redacted to protect sensitive
information. On the contrary, it can be potentially used for editing real documents and change the
content to commit fraud and spread misinformation.

8 REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

We believe our results are reproducible by following the training details in Section 3.4 of main
submission and Section 2, 3, 4, 5 from the supplementary material.

A APPENDIX

A.1 ABLATION STUDY

We ablate how loss terms Lz, LE, LF, and LG affect the unwarping results. We train Fuv and Fz
with different combinations of these loss terms and report the mean MSSIM and LD in Table 3.
Qualitative results for one scene are shown in Fig. 6 (appendix). In the basic version (listed as(a) (b) (c) _b), no_
conformality constraints (LE, LF and LG) are used and wp = 1 in Lz. The b + _w version introduces_
a weighting function that assigns a higher value to wp if a pixel is closer to the document boundary.
Introducing this loss improves the boundary; notice the white margin at the top and bottom in the
second column of Fig. 6. Introducing the conformality constraints alleviates the unusual stretch in
the texture and improves smoothness (Fig. 6, col. 3). Using both improves the boundary and the
texture smoothness (Fig. 6, col. 4) and achieves the best result.
