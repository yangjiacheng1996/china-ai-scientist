ABSTRACT

Improving the resilience of a network protects the system from natural disasters
and malicious attacks. This is typically achieved by introducing new edges, which
however may reach beyond the maximum number of connections a node could
sustain. Many studies then resort to the degree-preserving operation of rewiring,
which swaps existing edges AC, BD to new edges AB, CD. A significant line of
studies focuses on this technique for theoretical and practical results while leaving three limitations: network utility loss, local optimality, and transductivity. In
this paper, we propose ResiNet, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework
to discover Resilient Network topologies against various disasters and attacks.
ResiNet is objective agnostic which allows the utility to be balanced by incorporating it into the objective function. The local optimality, typically seen in
greedy algorithms, is addressed by casting the cumulative resilience gain into a sequential decision process of step-wise rewiring. The transductivity, which refers
to the necessity to run a computationally intensive optimization for each input
graph, is lifted by our variant of RL with auto-regressive permutation-invariant
variable action space. ResiNet is armed by our technical innovation, Filtration
**enhanced GNN (FireGNN), which distinguishes graphs with minor differences.**
It is thus possible for ResiNet to capture local structure changes and adapt its
decision among consecutive graphs, which is known to be infeasible for GNN.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that with a small number of rewiring operations, ResiNet achieves a near-optimal resilience gain on multiple graphs while
balancing the utility, with a large margin compared to existing approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION

Modern infrastructure systems, such as computer routing and electric power networks, are vulnerable to natural disasters and malicious attacks (Schneider et al., 2011). Consider the scenario where
the abnormality of one power supply station causes other power supply stations to overload, which
cascades more power supply to fail, resulting in a region-wide power outage. Figure 1 visualizes
this scenario that the failures of a dozen of nodes could jeopardize the connectivity and utility of the
EU power network with 217 nodes. The ability for a system to defend itself from such failures and
attacks is characterized by the network resilience. A resilient network should continue to function
and maintain an acceptable level of utility when part of the network fails.

A network becomes more resilient if some connections could backup the others. It is seemingly
straightforward to achieve resilience by adding redundant edges. However, it will not be practically
feasible as the nodes are usually already running at their full capacity. For example, a power supply
facility can only support a certain number of connections and cannot afford additional loads. In such
a regime, degree-preserving operations, such as edge rewiring, are desired (Schneider et al., 2011;
Rong & Liu, 2018; Yazıcıo˘glu et al., 2015; Zhou & Liu, 2014). Let G = (V, E) be a graph. An
edge rewiring operation alters the graph structure by removing AC and BD and adding AB and
_CD, where AC, BD ∈_ _E and AB, CD, AD, BC /∈_ _E.[1]_ Edge rewiring is empirically effective to
maximize network resilience and becomes the prevailing atomic operation in the literature. Despite
this, methods for improving network resilience via edge rewiring share several limitations: utility
loss, local optimality, and transduction.

1A few works have a different definition for the edge rewiring operation.

-  Network utility loss. Improving network resilience aims to protect the network utility from
degrading under attack and make the network continue functioning. Optimizing network
resilience without considering the network utility could jeopardize the functioning without
the presence of an attack.

-  Local optimality. Combinatorially choosing the edges to rewire to optimize the resilience is
proved to be NP-hard (Mosk-Aoyama, 2008). Previous studies predominantly seek approximate optimality through greedy-like algorithms, which yields local optimality in practice.

-  Transductivity. Traditional resilience optimization methods are transductive since they
search the resilience topology on a given graph. This search process has to be executed
for every graph and does not transfer between graphs, even if the graphs are only up to a
minor structure difference.

To tackle the challenges above, in this work, we present ResiNet, the first objective-agnostic
learning-based method for inductively discovering resilient network topologies. Frist, by formulating the cumulative gain of the objective into RL, ResiNet is agnostic to arbitrary objective function,
which makes resilience optimization practical in real applications by incorporating the utility into
the resilience. The nature of delayed gratification in RL also allows the agent to bypass local optimums caused by step-wise optimal actions. Second, the fact that graphs have different sizes and
arbitrary node permutations makes it challenging to solve transductivity when selecting edges with
deep learning. In this scenario, nodes can no longer be represented by their ID since it is computationally infeasible to train a model to handle all isomorphic graphs. Using an attention-based
mechanism (Vinyals et al., 2015) to identify edges and an auto-regressive space (Trivedi et al., 2020)
to formulate edge selection, an agent trained by ResiNet works on a wide range of graphs with different sizes and permutations.

Deep learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to many combinatorial optimization problems on graphs (Khalil et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018a; Karalias & Loukas,
2020). However, as we empirically observed, the combination of GNNs and RL cannot perform
well on the task of improving network resilience via edge rewiring. We suspect that this is caused
by a dilemma for the expressive power of GNN: If the representation power of the GNN is too weak
(e.g., the regular GNN), then it could not distinguish graphs with minor differences and will choose
similar actions in consecutive steps of RL. This causes the process to alternate between two graphs,
forming an infinite loop. If the representation power is too strong (e.g., SMP, IDGNN), it tends to
give similar representations to connected vertices, known as the oversmoothing phenomenon (Vignac et al., 2020; You et al., 2021). It is then difficult for the agent to distinguish vertices in a
connected component, causing large randomness in the output of the policy. This dilemma may lead
to the bad performance of selecting edges using regular GNNs and RL. Therefore, to successfully
select two edges from a degree-preserving evolving dynamic graph at each step, the implementation of ResiNet is armed with Filtration enhanced GNN (FireGNN), our technical innovation, to


-----

solve the above dilemma of the expressive power of GNN. FireGNN creates a series of subgraphs
(the filtration) by successively removing nodes from the graph, and aggregates the node representations from the subgraphs. It makes the GNN powerful when representing graphs while avoiding
oversmoothing as the node information are adequately acquired from a multi-step filtration. This
technical innovation is inspired by persistent homology and the approximation of the persistence
diagram (Edelsbrunner & Harer, 2008; Aktas et al., 2019; Hofer et al., 2020).

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1) We propose ResiNet, a data-driven framework to boost network resilience in a degreepreserving way with moderate loss of the network utility by forming resilience optimization
into a objective-agnostic sequential decision process of edge rewiring. Extensive experiments show that with a small number of rewiring operations, ResiNet achieves a nearoptimal resilience gain on multiple graphs while balancing network utilities. Existing approaches are outperformed by a large margin.

2) FireGNN, our technical innovation, balances the expressive power and the oversmoothing
issue through the graph filtration augmentation. FireGNN could distinguish very similar
graphs and distinguish connected vertices at the same time, which is essential to make the
combination of GNNs and RL work on the network resilience optimization.

3) ResiNet is the first to improve network resilience in an inductive way, with the specialized auto-regressive permutation-invariant size-variable policy network. Once an agent is
trained, it works on a wide range of graphs. The policy network is general enough to be
extended to other problems in constrained graph generation.

2 RELATED WORKS

**Network attacks and defenses** The problem of attacking a network is characterized by the target
_resilience measurement and the manipulation type. Depending on the application, network resilience_
is defined as a corresponding measure to quantify the network functionality, such as graph connectivity (Grassia et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2020). For particular networks (e.g., scale-free networks),
attacks appear in destroying critical nodes and critical connections (Grassia et al., 2021; Fan et al.,
2020; Zhao et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2017; Medya et al., 2020). Heuristic and learning-based attack methods (Holme et al., 2002; Iyer et al., 2013; Grassia et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2020) have been
proposed to target the critical subset of the network. To defend against potential attacks, various
defense strategies have been proposed to protect the network functionality from crashing and preserve some of its topologies. The commonly used defense manipulations include adding additional
edges (Li et al., 2019; Carchiolo et al., 2019), protecting vulnerable edges (Wang et al., 2014) and
rewiring two edges (Schneider et al., 2011; Chan & Akoglu, 2016; Buesser et al., 2011). Among
these manipulations, edge rewiring fits well to real-world applications as it induces less functionality
changes (e.g. degree preserving) to the original network and does not impose additional loads to the
vertices (Schneider et al., 2011; Rong & Liu, 2018; Yazıcıo˘glu et al., 2015; Zhou & Liu, 2014).

**GNNs for combinatorial optimization problems** The idea of applying GNNs to solve combinatorial optimization problems on graphs is becoming a promising yet challenging topic. Abundant
algorithms have been developed and can be classified into three categories. Supervised learning
**_approach combines GNNs with heuristics search procedures or solvers to solve classical combi-_**
natorial problems, such as graph matching (Bai et al., 2018), graph coloring (Lemos et al., 2019),
TSP (Li et al., 2018b; Joshi et al., 2019) and SAT (Wang et al., 2019). These methods require labeled instances and thus are difficult to generalize to large-scale instances directly. Unsupervised
**_learning approach (Karalias & Loukas, 2020) trains GNNs to parametrize a probability distribu-_**
tion over sets. The probabilistic proof achieves the existence of feasible solutions. After that, the
derandomized method is applied to decode the desired solutions. However, meeting complex constraints have not been supported yet. Reinforcement learning approach formulates a problem as
a Markov decision process with a proper reward function to guide the search towards an optimal
solution. Some classical CO problems have achieved remarkable results like TSP (Fu et al., 2020;
Khalil et al., 2017), Vehicle Routing Problem (Nazari et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2019),
SAT (Yolcu & P´oczos, 2019) and max-cut (Khalil et al., 2017). In this paper, we adopt the RL based
approach but with a specialized policy network.

**Positioning of this work** In this paper, we use only the edge rewiring operation to defend against
degree-based and centrality-based attacks while preserving the network utility.

In this section, we first present the problem formulation of maximizing network resilience while
preserving utility performance. We then discuss the graph resilience-aware environment design and
give the graph policy network which guides the process of edge rewiring. The problem of boosting
network resilience is formulated as a reinforcement learning task by iteratively rewiring the edges.

3.1 PROBLEM DEFINITION

An undirected graph is defined as G = (V, E), where V = {1, 2, . . ., N _} is the set of N nodes, E_
is the set of M edges, A ∈{0, 1}[N] _[×][N]_ is the adjacency matrix, and F ∈ R[N] _[×][d]_ is the d-dimensional
node feature matrix.[2] The degree of a node is defined as di = _j=1_ _[A][ij][, and a node with degree 0]_
is called an isolated node.

Let GG denote the set of graphs with the same node degrees as[P][N] G. Given the network resilience
function R(G) and the utility function U (G), the objective of boosting the resilience of G is to find
a target graph G[⋆] _∈_ GG, which maximizes the network resilience while preserving the network
utility. Formally, the problem of maximizing network resilience is formulated as

_′_ _′_
_G[⋆]_ = arg maxG[′] _∈GG_ _α · R(G_ ) + (1 − _α) · U_ (G ),

where α ∈ R is the scalar weight that balances the resilience and the utility.

Two examples of resilience functions, including the graph connectivity-based measurement (Schneider et al., 2011) and the spectrum-based measurement (e.g., adjacency matrix spectrum and Laplacian matrix spectrum), and two examples of utility functions, including global efficiency and local
efficiency, are given in Appendix B. Our formulation could generalize to other definitions of resilience and utility.

3.2 ROBUST GRAPH GENERATION VIA EDGE REWIRING AS MARKOV DECISION PROCESS

To satisfy the constraint of preserving the node degree, the resilience optimization of a given graph is
based on edge rewiring. We formulate this process into the MDP framework. The Markov property

2Without loss of generality, unweighted graphs are considered. Our framework can be extended to weighted
graphs with the weight as an additional edge feature.

denotes the fact that the graph obtained at time step t+1 relies only on the graph at time step t and the
rewire operation. As is illustrated in Figure 2, the environment performs the resilience optimization
in an auto-regressive step-wise way through a sequence of edge rewiring actions guided by ResiNet.
Given an input graph, the agent first decides whether to terminate if or not. If it chooses not to
terminate, it selects one edge from the graph to remove, receives the very edge it just selected as the
regression signal, and then selects another edge to remove. Four nodes of these two removed edges
are re-combined, forming two new edges to be added to the graph. The optimization process repeats
until the agent decides to terminate. The details of the design of the state, the action, the transition
dynamics, and the reward are presented as follows.

**State** The fully observable state of the environment is formulated as St = Gt, where Gt is the
current input graph at time step t. The node feature initialization strategy is given in Appendix C.3.

**Action** ResiNet is equipped with a node permutation-invariant, variable-dimensional action space.
Given a graph Gt, the action at is to select two edges and the rewiring order. The agent first chooses
an edge e1 = AC and a direction A → _C. Then conditioning on the state, e1, and the direction_
the agents chooses an edge e2 = BD such that AB, CD, AD, BC /∈ _E and a direction B →_ _D._
The heads of the two edges reconnect as a new edge AB and so does the tail CD. As A → _C,_
_B →_ _D and C →_ _A, D →_ _B refer to the same rewiring operation, the choice of the direction of_
_e1 is randomized (this randomized bit is still an input of choosing e2), as is shown in Figure 3. This_
effectively reduces the size of the action space by half. In this way, The action space is the set of all

2M directed edges can be candidates when selecting the second edge, subject to that it forms a

and the introduction of AB, CD.

**Transition dynamics** By the formulation of the action space, if the agent does not terminate at step
_t, the selected action must form an edge rewiring. This edge rewiring is executed by the environment_
and the graph transits to the new graph.

Note that in some other works, infeasible operations are also included in the action space (to make
the action space constant through the process) (You et al., 2018; Trivedi et al., 2020). In these works,
if the operation is infeasible, it is not executed and the state is not changed. This reduces the sample
efficiency, causes biased gradient estimation (Huang & Onta˜n´on, 2020), and makes the process to
be prone to stuck at the state (which requires manually disabling the specific action in the next step).
ResiNet takes the advantage of the action space composed of only feasible operations.

**Reward** ResiNet desires to optimize the resilience while preserving the utility, forming a complicated and possibly unknown objective function. Despite this, by Wakuta (1995), an MDP that
maximizes a complicated objective is up to an MDP that maximizes the linear combination of resilience and utility for some coefficient factor. This fact motivates us to design the reward as the
step-wise gain of such a linear combination as

_Rt = α · R(Gt+1) + (1 −_ _α) · U_ (Gt+1) − (α · R(Gt) + (1 − _α) · U_ (Gt)),

where R(G) and U (G) are the resilience and the utility functions, respectively. The cumulative
reward _t=0_ _[R][t][ up to time][ T][ is then the total gain of such a linear combination.]_

3.3 EDGE REWIRING POLICY

Having presented the details of the resilient graph generation environment, in this section, we describes the architecture of ResiNet in details. ResiNet is a policy network trained to maximize the
cumulative reward of the agent in the graph resilience-aware environment. At time step t, the policy network takes the current graph Gt as input and outputs an action at which represents the two
rewired edges, leading to the new state Gt+1 and the reward Rt.

3.3.1 FIREGNN VIA GRAPH FILTRATION ARGUMENTATION

Motivated by the graph filtration in persistent homology (Edelsbrunner & Harer, 2008), we propose
to enhance the expressivity of GNN via the graph filtration process by augmenting an input graph G.
To avoid the computational cost of calculating the persistence diagram at each step, the similarity
between the filtration process and resultant subgraphs after each attack motivates us to construct a
sequence of nested subgraphs of G as an approximate filtration, such that

(V, ∅) = G[(0)] _⊂_ _G[(1)]_ _⊂· · · ⊂_ _G[(][N]_ [)] = G,

where G[(][k][)] denotes the remaining graph after removing N − _k nodes in a particular task-dependent_
order, G[(][N] [)] is the original graph, and G[(0)] is an empty graph with no edge.

The sequence of nested subgraphs of G is termed the filtrated graph G. Regular GNN only operates
on the original graph G to obtain the node embedding for each node vi as

_h(vi) = φ(G[(][N]_ [)] = G)i,

where φ(·) denotes a standard GNN model.

**Node embedding** In FireGNN, by using the top K + 1 subgraphs in a graph filtration, the final
node embedding h(vi) of vi is obtained by

_h(vi) = AggN_ _h[(][N]_ _[−][K][)](vi), h[(][N]_ _[−][K][+1)](vi), . . ., h[(][N]_ _[−][1)](vi), h[(][N]_ [)](vi) _,_
 

where AggN ( ) denotes a node-level aggregation function, h[(][k][)](vi) is the node embedding of i in

_·_
the k-th subgraph G[(][k][)], and K [N ]. In practice, h[(][k][)](vi) is discarded when calculating h(vi) if
_∈_
_vi is isolated or not included in G[(][k][)]._

**Edge embedding** The directed edge embedding h[(][k][)](eij) of the edge from node i to node j in
each subgraph is obtained by combining the embeddings of the two end vertices in G[(][k][)] as

_h[(][k][)](eij) = mf_ AggN _→E_ _h[(][k][)](vi), h[(][k][)](vj)_ _,_
  

where AggN _→E(·) denotes an aggregation function for obtaining edge embedding from two end_
vertices (typically chosen from min, max, sum, difference, and multiplication). mf ( ) is a

_·_
multilayer perceptron (MLP) model that ensures the consistent dimension of edge embedding and
graph embedding.

The final embedding of the directed edge eij of the filtrated graph G is given by

_h(eij) = AggE_ _h[(][N]_ _[−][K][)](eij), h[(][N]_ _[−][K][+1)](eij), . . ., h[(][N]_ _[−][1)](eij), h[(][N]_ [)](eij) _,_
 

where AggE( ) denotes an edge-level aggregation function.

_·_

**Graph embedding** With the node embedding h[(][k][)](vi) of each subgraph available, the graph embedding h[(][k][)](G) of each subgraph is calculated by a readout functions (e.g., mean, sum) on all
non-isolated nodes in G[(][k][)] as

_h[(][k][)](G) = READOUT_ _h[(][k][)](vi)_ _vi_ _G[(][k][)]_ and d[(]i[k][)] 0 .
_∀_ _∈_ _≥_
 

The final graph embedding of the filtrated graph G is given by

_h(G) = AggG_ _h[(][N]_ _[−][K][)](G), h[(][N]_ _[−][K][+1)](G), . . ., h[(][N]_ _[−][1)](G), h[(][N]_ [)](G) _,_

By observing a sequence of nested subgraphs of G, a filtration process transforms an input graph
from the static graph to a sequences of subgraphs, which grants GNNs the capability to observe how
_G evolves and improve the expressivity in node, edge, and graph levels. We term the Filtrated graph_
**enhanced GNN as FireGNN.**

3.3.2 POLICY NETWORK

After obtaining the directed edge embedding h(eij) _∈_ R[2][|][E][|×][d] and the graph embedding
_h(G) ∈_ R[d] from the proposed FireGNN, armed with our specially designed autoregressive node
permutation-invariant dimension-variable action space, we can select the edge rewiring operation
for graphs with arbitrary sizes and node-permutations. The detailed architecture of ResiNet and the
mechanism of obtaining the action at are presented as follows.

**Auto-regressive latent action selection** An edge rewiring action at at time step t involves the
prediction of the termination probability a[(0)]t and the selection of two edges (a[(1)]t and a[(2)]t [)][ and the]
rewiring order. The action space of a[(0)]t is binary, however, the selection of two edges imposes a
huge action space in O(E[2]), which is too expensive to sample from even for a small graph. Instead
of selecting two edges simultaneously, we decompose the joint action at into at = (a[(0)]t _[, a]t[(1)][, a]t[(2)][)][,]_
where a[(1)]t and a[(2)]t are two existing edges which do not share any common node (recall that a[(1)]t
and a[(2)]t are directed edges for an undirected graph). Thus the probability of at is formulated as

P(at|st) = P(a[(0)]t _[|][s][t][)][P][(][a]t[(1)][|][s][t][, a]t[(0)][)][P][(][a]t[(2)][|][s][t][, a]t[(0)][, a]t[(1)][)][ .]_

**Predicting the termination probability** The first policy network π0(·) takes the graph embedding
as input and outputs the probability distribution of the first action that decides to terminate or not as

P(a[(0)]t

_[|][s][t][) =][ π][0][(][h][(][G][))][,]_

where π0( ) is implemented by a two layer MLP. Then a[(0)]t Ber(P(a[(0)]t

_·_ _∼_ _[|][s][t][))][ ∈{][0][,][ 1][}][.]_

**Selecting two edges** If the signal a[(0)]t given by the agent decides to continue to rewire, two edges
are then selected in an auto-regressive way. The signal of continuing to rewire a[(0)]t is input to the
selection of two edges as a one-hot encoding vector lc. The second policy network π1( ) takes the

obtain the first edge selection probability distribution. Then, to select the second edge, the graph
embedding h(G) and the first selected edge embedding h(e[(1)]t [)][ and][ l][c] [are concatenated and fed into]
the third policy network π2(·). π2(·) obtains the latent vector l2 for selecting the second edge using
a respective pointer network. The process can be formulated as

_l1 = π1([h(G), lc])_

P(a[(1)]t _t_ [) =][ f][1][(][l][1][, h][(][e][ij][)))][,][ ∀][e][ij]

_[|][s][t][, a][(0)]_ _[∈]_ _[E]_
_l2 = π2([h(G), he(1)t_ _[, l][c][])]_

P(a[(2)]t _t_ _[, a]t[(0)][) =][ f][2][(][l][2][, h][(][e][ij][)))][,][ ∀][e][ij]_

_[|][s][t][, a][(1)]_ _[∈]_ _[E,]_

where πi( ) is implemented by a two layer MLP model. [ _,_ ] denotes the concatenation operator,
_he(1)t_ is the embedding of the first selected edge at time step· _· t ·, and fi(·) is a pointer network._

4 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we demonstrate the advantage of ResiNet in optimizing network resilience, generalizing to unseen graphs, and accommodating multiple resilience and utility metrics. The experimental
results show that the optimization of ResiNet is achieved with fewer edge rewiring operations.


-----

4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

**Datasets** Synthetic datasets and the real EU power network (Zhou & Bialek, 2005) are used to
demonstrate the performance of ResiNet in both transductive and inductive settings. The details of
data generation and the statistics of the datasets are presented in Appendix C.1.

**Baselines** We compare ResiNet with existing graph resilience optimization algorithms, including
the hill climbing (HC) (Schneider et al., 2011), the greedy algorithm (Chan & Akoglu, 2016), the
simulated annealing (SA) (Buesser et al., 2011), and the evolutionary algorithm (EA) (Zhou & Liu,
2014). It should be noted that all traditional baselines are transductive. Since there is no neuralversion baseline, we provide one by replacing FireGNN with a regular GNN. The ResiNet’s training
setup is detailed in Appendix C.2. All algorithms are repeated for three random seeds using default
hyper-parameters to obtain the averaged performance.

4.2 COMPARISONS TO THE BASELINES

In this set of experiments, we first compare ResiNet to the baselines in optimizing the combination
of resilience and utility with weight coefficient α ∈{0, 0.5}. The graph connectivity-based metric
is used as the resilience metric and the global efficiency is used as the utility metric. The test is
conducted on 4 transductive settings and 3 inductive settings.

Table 1 records the metric gain and the required number of rewiring of different methods under the
same maximal rewiring budget. ResiNet outperforms all baselines consistently on all datasets. Note
that this performance may be achieved under a much fewer number of rewiring operations, such as
the BA-15 with α = 0. In contrast, even approximately searching for all possible new edges, the
greedy algorithm is still trapped into a local optimum by maximizing the one-step resilience gain.
For SA, the initial temperature and the temperature decay rate need to be carefully tuned for each
network. EA performs worse with a limited rewiring budget due to the numerous rewiring operations
required in the internal process (e.g., the crossover operator). It should be noted that the poor
performance of a combination of regular GNNs and RL (GNN+RL), compared to ResiNet, validates
the challenges of improving network resilience via edge rewiring and indicates the effectiveness of
ResiNet with FireGNN.

In general, the metric gain is more significant for larger graphs, which implies that it is reasonable
and cost-effective to improve the resilience of large networks. All baselines are compared under the
same rewiring budget of 20 since each edge rewiring introduces economic costs for real systems. It
should be noted that solutions under a large rewiring budget like 200 will not be applicable in practice due to the tremendous rewiring cost. We record the performance and speed of each algorithm
for a maximal rewiring budget of 200 in Appendix Table 4.

4.3 GENERALIZATION

In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to show that ResiNet generalizes to different utility
and resilience metrics, various attack strategies, and unseen graphs. We do not compare ResiNet
with other algorithms on the inductive setting because existing algorithms are transductive.

To explore the complicated objective of resilience and utility, the BA-15 network is taken as an
example to be optimized by ResiNet to obtain the approximate Pareto frontier. The Pareto points are
shown in Figure 8 to denote the optimum under different objectives. Surprisingly, the initial gain of
resilience (from around 0.21 to around 0.24) is without loss of the utility, which incentivizes almost
every network to conduct such optimization at least to some extent when feasible.

To demonstrate that ResiNet can learn from the networks for accommodating different utility and
resilience metrics, we conduct experiments based on the BA-15 and EU datasets by using multiple
different resilience metrics and different utility metrics (details are in Appendix B). The results are
included in Appendix D.2. The network structures are visualized in Figure 7 and Figure 10.

To demonstrate the inductivity of ResiNet, we first train ResiNet on two different datasets, and the
data setting is recorded in Table 2. We evaluate its performance on an individual test dataset. These
datasets are unknown to ResiNet and have not been observed during the training process. Finetuning is not allowed. We report the averaged resilience gain for the graphs with the same number

20. We report the weighted combination of the graph connectivity-based resilience and the network
efficiency improvement (in percentage) with the weighted coefficient α ∈{0, 0.5}. Results are
averaged over 3 runs. We report the rewiring number inside the bracket.

of nodes for each dataset. The result of BA-10-30 is shown in Figure 4 and the results of the other
datasets are deferred to Appendix D.2. Figure 4 shows a nearly linear improvement of resilience
with the increasing of graph size, which is also consistent with the results in the transductive setting
that larger graphs usually have a larger room to improve.

5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS

In this work, we propose a general, learning-based framework, ResiNet, for the inductive discovery
of resilient network topologies. The framework is practically feasible as it also preserves the utility
of the networks. ResiNet is the first to formulate the problem of boosting network resilience as an
MDP, with a specialized auto-regressive permutation-invariant variable action space. This variant
of MDP allows the agent to handle graphs of different sizes and isomorphisms. Once an agent is
trained, it inductively works on a wide range of graphs and is ready to be deployed to real systems.
Our technical innovation, FireGNN, is a powerful technique for node and graph representations,
which is a suitable replacement to other GNNs, especially in RL. It balances the expressive power
and the oversmoothing issue of GNNs and could distinguish graphs and connected nodes at the same
time. Both ResiNet and FireGNN are general enough to be applied to a variety of problems in graph
theory, network theory, combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and their applications.

An interesting direction of future work is to obtain a better approximation algorithm for the persistence diagram. The current implementation includes an average operation across the entire filtration,
which is computationally expensive when the graph is large and forces us to truncate the filtration in
our implementations. An efficient and accurate approximation algorithm will grant FireGNN better
feasibility in real applications.

A EXTENDED RELATED WORK

**Network resilience and utility**

Network utility refers to the system’s quality to provide a certain service, for example transmitting
electricity in power networks and transmitting packages in routing networks. A popular metric
for network utility is the network efficiency (Latora & Marchiori, 2003; Boccaletti et al., 2006).
Network resilience measures the ability of preventing the utility loss under failures and attacks. Our
goal is to improve both network resilience and utility by network structure manipulations.

In many previous works, despite that the resilience could be improved, the utility may dramatically
drop at the same time (Li et al., 2019; Carchiolo et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2014; Schneider et al.,
2011; Chan & Akoglu, 2016; Buesser et al., 2011). This is contradicting with the idea behind
improving network resilience and will be infeasible in real-world applications.

**Multi-views graph augmentation for GNNs**

Multi-views graph augmentation is one efficient way to improve expressive power or combine domain knowledge, which is adapted based on the task’s prior (Hu et al., 2020). For example, GCC
(Qiu et al., 2020) generates multiple subgraphs from the same ego network. DGI (Velickovic et al.,
2019) maximizes the mutual information between global and local information. GCA (You et al.,
2020) adaptively incorporates various priors for topological and semantic aspects of the graph. (Hassani & Khasahmadi, 2020) contrasts representations from first-order neighbors and a graph diffusion. In our problem, two desired properties are different edge representations and the capability to
predict accurate network resilience gain. Motivated by the calculation process of persistent homology (Edelsbrunner & Harer, 2008), we apply the filtration process to enhance the expressive power
of GNNs.

**Deep graph generation models**

Deep graph generation models learn the distribution of given graphs and generate more novel graphs,
which could be classified as unconditional generation methods and conditional generation methods

Figure 5: Illustration of the graph connectivity-based measurement calculation with a scale-free
example graph under node degree-based malicious attack. Each snapshot demonstrates the attack
on the red node, which removes the red node and its adjacent (dashed) edges, leading to a next
remnant graph. The attacker recalculates the node degree and repeatedly seeks for the remaining
node with a maximum degree as the next target. In the end, the entire graph becomes disconnected
when each node cannot reach other nodes.

(Guo & Zhao, 2020). Specifically, edge transformation conditioned on another graph (a.k.a. graph
translation) is more relevant to our work since the edge rewiring process can be regarded as operations on the previous graph via edge addition and deletion. Some works utilize the encoder-decoder
framework by learning latent representation of the input graph through the encoder and then generating the target graph through the decoder. For example, GCPN (You et al., 2018) incorporates
chemistry domain rules on molecular graph generation. GT-GAN (Guo et al., 2018) proposes a
GAN-based model on malware cyber-network synthesis. GraphOpt (Trivedi et al., 2020) learns
an implicit model to discover an underlying optimization mechanism of the graph generation using inverse reinforcement learning. Although exploiting a similar encoder-decoder framework, our
approach differs from existing works by the rigid constraint of the studied task: node degree preservation, which imposes additional requirements for the expressive power of GNNs.

B DEFINITIONS OF DIFFERENT OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS

In this section, we present resilience definitions and utility definitions used in our experiments.

B.1 RESILIENCE DEFINITIONS

Three kinds of resilience metrics are considered:

-  The graph connectivity-based measurement (Schneider et al., 2011) is defined as


(G) = [1]
_R_ _N_


_s(q),_

_q=1_

X


where s(q) is the fraction of nodes in the largest connected remaining graph after removing
_q nodes from graph G according to certain attack strategy, as shown in Figure 5. The range_
of possible values of R is [1/N, 1/2], where these two extreme values correspond to a star
network and a fully connected network, respectively.

-  The spectral radius (SR) denotes the largest eigenvalue λ1 of an adjacency matrix.

-  The algebraic connectivity (AC) represents the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian
matrix of G.


-----

B.2 UTILITY DEFINITIONS

In this paper, the global and local communication efficiency are used as two measurements of the
network utility, which are widely applied across diverse applications of network science, such as
transportation and communication networks (Latora & Marchiori, 2003; Boccaletti et al., 2006).

The average efficiency of a network G is defined as inversely proportional to the average over pairwise distances (Latora & Marchiori, 2001) as


_E(G) =_


_d(i, j)_ _[,]_


_N_ (N − 1)


_−_ _i≠_ _j∈V_

where N denotes the total nodes in a network and d(i, j) denotes the length of the shortest path
between a node i and another node j.


Given the average efficiency, we can calculate the global efficiency and local efficiency.

-  The global efficiency of a network G is defined as (Latora & Marchiori, 2001; 2003)

_E(G)_
_Eglobal(G) =_

_E(G[ideal])_ _[,]_

where G[ideal] is the “ideal” fully-connected graph on N nodes, and the range of Eglobal(G)
is [0, 1].

-  The local efficiency of a network G measures a local average of pairwise communication
efficiencies and is defined as (Latora & Marchiori, 2001)


_Elocal(G) = [1]_ _E(Gi),_

_N_

_iX∈V_

where Gi is the local subgraph including only of a node i’s one-hop neighbors, but not the
node i itself. The range of Elocal(G) is [0, 1].


C IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF RESINET

In this section, we provide the implementation details of ResiNet, including dataset, network structure training strategies and node feature construction. Moreover, we discussed the role of FireGNN
in ResiNet and analyze current limitations of ResiNet and future work.

C.1 DATASET

We first present the data generation strategies. Synthetic datasets are generated using the BarabasiAlbert (BA) model (known as scale-free graphs) (Albert & Barab´asi, 2002), with the graph size
varying from |N _|=10 to |N_ _|=200. During the data generation process, each node is connected to_
two existing nodes. BA graphs are chosen since they are vulnerable to malicious attacks and are
commonly used to test network resilience optimization algorithms(Bollob´as & Riordan, 2004). We
test the performance of ResiNet on both transductive and inductive settings.

-  Transductive setting The algorithm is trained and tested on the same network.

**– Randomly generated synthetic BA networks, denoted by BA-m, are adopted to test**
the performance of ResiNet on networks of various sizes, where m ∈{15, 50, 100} is
the graph size.

**– The real EU power network (Zhou & Bialek, 2005) is used to validate the performance**
of ResiNet on real networks.

-  Inductive setting Two groups of synthetic BA networks denoted by BA-m-n are randomly generated to test ResiNet’s inductivity, where m is the minimal graph size, and n
indicates the maximal graph size. We first randomly generate the fixed number of BA networks as the training data to train ResiNet and then evaluate ResiNet’s performance directly
on the test dataset without any additional optimization. We only consider ResiNet for the
inductive setting since other methods are all transductive.

Table 2 summarizes the statistics of each dataset.


-----

Table 2: Statistics of graphs used for resilience maximization. Both transductive and inductive
settings (⋆) are included. Consistent with our implementation, we report the number of edges by
transforming undirected graphs to directed graph so that the edge rewiring has the fixed execution
order. For the inductive setting, we report the maximum number of edges. The action space size of
the edge rewiring is measured by 2|E|[2].

Dataset Node Edge Action Space Size Train/Test Setting

BA-15 15 54 5832 Null Transductive
BA-50 50 192 73728 Null Transductive
BA-100 100 392 307328 Null Transductive
EU 217 640 819200 Null Transductive
BA-10-30 (⋆) 10-30 112 25088 1000/500 Inductive
BA-20-200 (⋆) 20-200 792 1254528 4500/360 Inductive

C.2 RESINET SETUP

In this section, we provide detailed parameter setting and training strategies for ResiNet.

Our proposed FireGNN is used as the graph encoder in ResiNet, including a 5-layer defined GIN
(Xu et al., 2019) as the backbone. The hidden dimensions for node embedding and graph embedding
in each hidden layer are set to 64 and the SeLU activation function (Klambauer et al., 2017) is used
after each message passing propagate (Li et al., 2020a). Graph normalization strategy is adopted to
stabilize the training of GNN (Cai et al., 2020). The jumping knowledge network (Xu et al., 2018)
is used to aggregate node features from different layers of the GNN.

The overall policy is trained by using the highly tuned implementation of proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm (Schulman et al., 2017). Several critical strategies for stabilizing and accelerating the training of ResiNet are used, including advantage normalization (Andrychowicz et al.,
2021), the dual-clip PPO (the dual clip parameter is set to 10) (Ye et al., 2020), and the usage of
different optimizers for policy network and value network. Additionally, since the step-wise reward
range is small (around 0.01), we scale the reward by a factor of 10 to aim the training of ResiNet.
The policy head model and value function model use two separated FireGNN encoder networks with
the same architecture. ResiNet is trained using two separate Adam optimizers (Kingma & Ba, 2015)
with batch size 256 and a linearly decayed learning rate of 0.0007 for the policy network and a linearly decayed learning rate of 0.0007 for the value network. The aggregation function of FireGNN
is defined as an attention mechanism-based linear weighted combination.

C.3 NODE FEATURE CONSTRUCTION

The widely-used node degree feature cannot significantly benefit the network resilience optimization
of a single graph due to the degree-preserving rewiring. Therefore, we construct node features for
each input graph to aid the transductive learning and inductive learning, including

-  The 8-dimensional position embedding originating from the Transformer (Vaswani et al.,
2017) is adopted as the measurement of the vulnerability of each node under attack. If the
attack order is available, we can encode it into the position embedding. If the attack order
is unknown, node degree, node betweenness, and other node priority metrics can be used
for approximating the node importance in practice.

-  The distance encoding strategy (Li et al., 2020b).

-  One-hot encoding denoting whether the attack causes the node removal or just because all
adjacent nodes are removed.

C.4 BASELINE SETUP

All baselines share the same action space with ResiNet, and they uses the same action masking
strategy to block invalid actions as ResiNet does. The maximal objective evaluation is consistent
for all algorithms. Other settings of baselines are consistent with the default values in their paper.

maximizing resilience. Results are averaged over 3 runs.


The early-stopping strategy is used for baselines, which means the search process terminates if no
improvement is obtained in successive 1000 objective function calling trials.

D ABLATION STUDY AND EXTENDED EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS


In this section, we provide the ablation study about the importance of FireGNN and present additional experimental results.

D.1 FIREGNN


In FireGNN, the total number of subgraphs involved in calculating the final node embedding, edge
embedding, and graph embedding, are determined by the filtration order K ∈ [0, N − 1], where
_K = 0 means only the original graph is used and K = N −_ 1 means there are total N subgraphs
used. We run a grid search to explore the effect of the filtration order on ResiNet’s performance.
As shown in Figure 6, ResiNet only achieves a minor gain of around 5% without FireGNN. The
performance improved significantly with K greater than zero, and ResiNet obtained the optimal
resilience gain of about 35 % on BA-15 when K ≥ 5. We only report the performance when K ≤ 8
since the BA-15 loses all connections when more than eight critical nodes are removed.

Besides the BA-15 dataset, we also conducted the ablation experiments of FireGNN on large
datasets, including the BA-50, BA-100, and EU power network. We found that without FireGNN,
ResiNet hardly learns to find a positive gain, so it often chooses to stop at the first step, which may
further validate the effectiveness of FireGNN.

It is worth pointing out that the task-dependent order of node removal will affect the filtration. For
example, the scale-free networks lost all connections under the degree-based attack on half nodes on
average, while it maintains its most topologies under some other attacks. For the network resilience
task, we are inspired by the definition of the graph connectivity-based resilience metric, with the
adaptive node degree centrality to determine the node removal order. Nodes with larger degrees are
first removed, and the ties are broken by arbitrary.

We provide possible reasons why FireGNN is critical for the network resilience task as



-  Each rewire only changes the graph by four edges, so the graph embedding and the node
embedding may not change significantly at two steps to provide essential information for
the RL agent to make new accurate decisions. For example, we empirically found that the
RL agent can stick into an action loop, which means that after the rewiring of A-C and
_B-D to obtain A-B and C-D at step t, the agent may choose to rewire the new forming_
edges back at step t + 1, forming an infinite loop.


-----

Table 3: Performance gain (in percentage) of ResiNet in optimizing varying objectives on the BA-15
network. All objectives are optimized with the same hyper-parameters, which means that we did not
tune hyper-parameters for objectives except for RD.

|---|---|

|---|---|



-  The dominating nodes may potentially be regarded as outliers which can shade other nodes’
unique features, which is problematic for the agent’s learning to distinguish different nodes.
By removing the dominating nodes, the residual nodes in each subgraph have the freedom
to express their salient features.

-  It might also be potentially valuable for other edge embedding-based tasks, such as graph
generation, recommendation, and link prediction.

D.2 MORE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

This section provides additional experimental results, including the optimization with different resilience and utility metrics and validating ResiNet’s inductivity on larger datasets. Finally, we analyze the current limitations of ResiNet.

D.2.1 LEARNING TO BALANCE MORE UTILITY AND RESILIENCE METRICS

As shown in Figure 7, we conduct extensive experiments on the BA-15 network to demonstrate
that ResiNet can learn to optimize graphs with different resilience and utility metrics and to defend
against other types of attacks besides the node degree-based attack, such as the node betweennessbased attack.

Table 3 records the improvements in percentage of ResiNet for varying objectives on the BA-15
dataset. As visualized in Figure 7, ResiNet is not limited to defend against the node degree-based
attack (Figure 7 (b)-(j)) and also learns to defend against the betweenness-based attack (Figure
7 (k)-(s)). Total three resilience metrics are used, with R denoting the graph connectivity-based
resilience metric, SR being the spectral radius and SR representing the algebraic connectivity.
Total two utility metrics are adopted, including the global efficiency Eglobal and the local efficiency
_Elocal. Not surprisingly, the optimized network with an improvement of about 3.6% for defending_
the betweenness-based attack also has a higher resilience (around 7.8%) against the node-degree
attack. This may be explained as the similarity between node degree and betweenness for a small
network.

To balance utility and resilience simultaneously, the distribution of Pareto points obtained by
ResiNet on the BA-15 dataset in Figure 8 implies that the maximization of the resilience and utility
may not be satisfied simultaneously. The simultaneous improvements in resilience and utility could
occur if the poorly designed original network has weak resilience and utility.

D.2.2 INDUCTIVITY ON LARGER DATASETS

Even with limited computational resources, armed with the autoregressive action space and the
power of FireGNN, ResiNet can be trained fully end-to-end on graphs with hundreds of nodes using
RL. We demonstrate the inductive ability of ResiNet on graphs of different sizes by training ResiNet
on the BA-20-200 dataset, which consists of graphs with the size ranging from 20 to 200, and then
report its performance on directly guiding the edges selections on unseen test graphs. The filtration

attack with varying combinations of resilience and utility. For three resilience metrics, R denotes
the graph connectivity-based resilience metric; SR is the spectral radius; SR represents the algebraic connectivity. For two utility metrics, Eglobal denotes the global efficiency, and Elocal is the
local efficiency.

order K is set to 1 for the computational limitation. As shown in Figure 9, we can see that ResiNet
has the best performance for N ∈ [70, 100]. The degrading performance with the graph size may
be explained by the fact that larger graphs require a larger filtration order for ResiNet to work well.
A more stable performance improvement of ResiNet is observed with the increment of graph size
when trained to optimize network resilience and utility simultaneously, and ResiNet possibly finds
a strategy to balance these two metrics.

D.2.3 INSPECTION OF OPTIMIZED NETWORKS

Moreover, to provide a deeper inspection into the optimized network structure, we take the EU
power network as an example to visualize its network structure and the optimized networks given
by ResiNet with different objectives. Comparing to the original EU network, Figure 10 (b) is the
network structure obtained by only optimizing the graph connectivity-based resilience. We can
observe a more crowded region on the left, consistent with the “onion-like” structure concluded in
previous studies. If we consider the combination gain of both resilience and utility, we observe a
more compact clustering “crescent moon”-like structure as shown in Figure 10 (c).

D.2.4 PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS UNDER A LARGE REWIRING BUDGET

In this section, we present the resilience improvement and the required number of edge rewiring of
each algorithm under a large rewiring budget of 20. The running speed is also presented to compare
the running time efficiency of each algorithm.

As shown in Table 4, traditional methods improve the network resilience significantly compared to
ResiNet under a large rewiring budget of 200. However, traditional methods are still undesired in
such a case since a solution with a large rewiring budget is not applicable in practice due to the vast
cost of adding many new edges into a real system. For example, the actual number of rewiring budget
for EA is hard to calculate since it is a population-based algorithm, so it is omitted in Table 4. All
baselines adopt the early-stopping strategy that they will terminate if there is no positive resilience
gain in a successive 1000 steps.

Table 5 indicates that the time it takes for the benchmark algorithm to solve the problem usually
increases as the test data set size increases. In contrast, once trained, our proposed ResiNet is
suitable for testing on large datasets since the model size is fixed.

D.2.5 LIMITATIONS

It should be noted that the weighted combination of resilience and utility setting can be slightly unfair for ResiNet due to the additional RL training burden. Despite our highly tuned implementation
of ResiNet, training RL is known as challenging, with two reward functions with different ranges
posing another challenge. Moreover, due to limited computational resources, we only train ResiNet
with all non-empty subgraphs in FireGNN on the BA-15 network as a transductive and BA-10-30
network as an inductive setting. For networks with more than 50 nodes, we only use the top-2
subgraphs in the filtration, as we observed to balance the computational effort and the satisfying
performance. This may explain the performance of ResiNet is slightly weaker than several baselines
on larger networks.

Another point is that for ResiNet, the maximum episode length is set to 20 steps on all graphs,
which means all solutions given by ResiNet require no longer than 20 edge rewiring operations.
For example, the optimal solution obtained by ResiNet defending against node degree-based attacks
on BA-15 only requires a minimum of six steps to arrive at the target graph. A larger filtration
order, a longer episode length, or a powerful RL learning algorithm should be expected to boost the
performance of ResiNet further.

Despite the success of ResiNet armed with our proposal FireGNN in both the transductive and
inductive settings, we empirically observe that the trained agent only works well on the unseen
datasets with a similar setting as training. How to improve further the inductivity of ResiNet is left
as another future work.
