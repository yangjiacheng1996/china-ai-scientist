ABSTRACT

Statistical properties such as mean and variance often change over time in time
series, i.e., time-series data suffer from a distribution shift problem. This change
in temporal distribution is one of the main challenges that prevent accurate timeseries forecasting. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective normalization method called reversible instance normalization (RevIN), a generallyapplicable normalization-and-denormalization method with learnable affine transformation. The proposed method is symmetrically structured to remove and restore the statistical information of a time-series instance, leading to significant
performance improvements in time-series forecasting, as shown in Fig. 1. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of RevIN via extensive quantitative and qualitative
analyses on various real-world datasets, addressing the distribution shift problem.

1 INTRODUCTION

Time-series forecasting plays a significant role in addressing various daily problems, including
health care, economics, and traffic data analyses (Kim et al., 2021a; Ahmadi et al., 2019; Park
et al., 2020). Recently, time-series forecasting models have achieved outstanding performance on
these problems, overcoming several challenges, such as long-term forecasting (Zhou et al., 2021;
Liu et al., 2021) and missing value imputation (Zhang et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021b). However, the
time-series forecasting models often suffer badly from a unique characteristic in time-series data:
their statistical properties, e.g., mean and variance, can change over time. This is widely known as
the distribution shift problem, and it can yield discrepancies between the distributions of the training
and test data of the forecasting models. In time-series forecasting tasks, the training and test data
are usually divided from the original data based on a specific point in time. Accordingly, they often
hardly overlap, which is a common reason for model performance degradation. Furthermore, the input sequences to the model can have different underlying distributions as well. We can assume that
the discrepancy between different input sequences can significantly degrade the model performance.

Under this assumption, if we remove non-stationary information from the input sequences, specifically, the mean and standard deviation of the instances, the discrepancy in the data distributions will
be reduced, thereby improving model performance. However, applying such normalization to the
model input can cause another problem since it can prevent the model from capturing the original
data distribution. It removes non-stationary information that can be important to predict future values
in the forecasting task. The model would need to reconstruct the original distribution only using the
normalized input, which degrades its forecasting performance due to the inherent limitation. Thus,
if we explicitly return the information removed by input normalization back to the model, the model
will not have to rebuild the original distribution by itself while keeping the advantage of normalizing
the input. To accomplish this, we propose to reverse the normalization applied to the input data in
the output layer, i.e., to denormalize the model output using the normalization statistics.

Inspired by this, we propose a simple yet effective normalization-and-denormalization method, re**versible instance normalization (RevIN), which first normalizes the input sequences and then de-**
normalizes the model output sequences to solve the time-series forecasting problems against distribution shift. RevIN is symmetrically structured to return the original distribution information to the
model output by scaling and shifting the output in the denormalization layer in an amount equivalent
to the shifting and scaling of the input data in the normalization layer. To verify the effectiveness of
RevIN, we conduct extensive quantitative evaluations using several state-of-the-art time-series forecasting methods as the baselines: Informer (Zhou et al., 2021), N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al., 2020),
and SCINet (Liu et al., 2021). We also provide an in-depth analysis of the behavior of the proposed
approach, including verification of the assumptions on reversible instance normalization.

RevIN is a flexible, end-to-end trainable layer that can be applied to any arbitrarily chosen layers,
effectively suppressing non-stationary information (mean and variance of the instance) in one layer
and restoring it in another layer at a virtually symmetric position, e.g., input and output layers. Despite its remarkable performance, there has been no work on generalizing and expanding instancewise normalization-and-denormalization as a flexibly applicable, trainable layer in the time-series
domain. Recently, deep learning-based time-series forecasting approaches, such as Informer (Zhou
et al., 2021) and N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al., 2020), have shown outstanding performance in timeseries forecasting. However, they have overlooked the importance of normalization, merely using
simple global preprocessing of the model input without further exploration and expecting their endto-end deep learning model to replace the role. Despite the simplicity of our method, there have
been no cases of using such techniques in modern deep-learning-based time-series forecasting approaches (Zhou et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Oreshkin et al., 2020). In this sense, we introduce the
importance of an appropriate normalization method for deep-learning-based time-series approaches.
We propose a carefully designed, deep-learning-friendly module for time-series forecasting by combining the method with the learnable affine transformation, which has been widely accepted in recent
deep-learning-based normalization work (Ulyanov et al., 2016).

In summary, our contributions are as follows:

-  We propose a simple yet effective normalization-and-denormalization method for timeseries, called RevIN, which is symmetrically structured to remove and restore the statisti

cal information of a time-series instance. The proposed method is generally applicable to
arbitrary deep neural networks with negligible cost.

-  By adding RevIN to the baseline, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on seven largescale real-world datasets by a significant margin.

-  We conduct extensive evaluations of RevIN using quantitative analysis and qualitative visualizations to verify its effectiveness, addressing the distribution shift problem.

2 RELATED WORK

**Time-series forecasting.** Time-series forecasting methods are mainly categorized into three distinct approaches: (1) statistical methods, (2) hybrid methods, and (3) deep learning-based methods.
Statistical models are theoretically well guaranteed and have several advantages, including interpretability. As an example of the statistical models, exponential smoothing forecasting (Holt, 2004;
Winters, 1960) is a well-established benchmark for predicting future values. To further boost performance, recent work proposed a hybrid model (Smyl, 2020) that incorporates a deep learning module
with a statistical model. It achieved better performance than statistical methods in the M4 timeseries forecasting competition. The deep learning-based method basically follows the sequenceto-sequence framework to model the time-series forecasting. Initially, deep learning-based models
utilized variations of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, to overcome the limitation of the
limited receptive field, several studies utilized advanced techniques, such as the dilatation and attention module. For instance, SCINet (Liu et al., 2021) and Informer (Zhou et al., 2021) modified
the sequence-to-sequence-based model to improve performance for long sequences. However, most
previous deep learning-based models are hard to interpret compared to statistical models. Thus, inspired by statistical models, N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al., 2020) designed an interpretable layer for
time-series forecasting by encouraging the model to learn trend, seasonality explicitly, and residual
components. This model shows superior performance on the M4 competition dataset.

**Distribution shift.** Although there are various models for time-series forecasting, they often suffer from non-stationary time-series, where the data distribution changes over time. Domain adaptation (Tzeng et al., 2017; Ganin et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018) and domain generalization (Wang
et al., 2021; Li et al., 2018; Muandet et al., 2013) are common ways to alleviate the distribution
shift. A domain adaptation algorithm attempts to reduce the distribution gap between source and
target domains. A domain generalization algorithm only relies on the source domain and hopes to
generalize on the target domain. Both domain adaptation and generalization have a common objective, which bridges the gap between source and target distributions. However, defining a domain
is not straightforward in non-stationary time series since the data distribution shifts over time. Recently, Du et al. (Du et al., 2021) proposed Adaptive RNNs to handle the distribution shift problems
of non-stationary time-series data. It first characterizes the distribution information by splitting the
training data into periods. Then, it matches the distributions of the discovered periods to generalize the model. However, unlike Adaptive RNNs, which is costly, RevIN is simple yet effective and
model-agnostic. The method can be easily adopted to any deep neural network.

3 PROPOSED METHOD

This section proposes reversible instance normalization to alleviate the distribution shift problem in
time-series, which is known to cause a substantial discrepancy between the training and test data
distributions. Section 3.1 describes the proposed method in detail, and Section 3.2 discusses how
our approach mitigates the distribution discrepancy in time-series data.

3.1 REVERSIBLE INSTANCE NORMALIZATION

Given a set of input X = {x[(][i][)]}i[N]=1 [and the corresponding target][ Y][ =][ {][y][(][i][)][}]i[N]=1[, we consider a mul-]
tivariate time-series forecasting task in discrete time, where N denotes the number of sequences.
Let K, Tx, and Ty denote the number of variables, the input sequence length, and the model prediction length, respectively. Given an input sequence x[(][i][)] _∈_ R[K][×][T][x], we aim to solve the time-series
forecasting problem, which is to predict the subsequent values y[(][i][)] _∈_ R[K][×][T][y] . In RevIN, the input

Figure 2: Overview of the proposed method. We illustrate an example of a univariate case, where
_x[(][i][)]_ _∈_ R[1][×][T][x] ; the input data x[(][i][)] is actually multivariate (See Section 3.1). In RevIN, the (a-1)
instance normalization and (a-2) denormalization are symmetrically structured to remove (a-3) nonstationary information from one layer and restore it on the other layer. Here, RevIN is applied to
the input and output layers. The (a-3) non-stationary information includes statistical properties from
the input data: mean µ, variance σ[2], and learnable affine parameters γ, β. The normalization layer
transforms the (b-1) original data distribution into a (b-2) mean-centered distribution, where the
distribution discrepancy between different instances is reduced. Using ˆx, the model predicts the
future values ˜y following the (b-3) distribution where non-stationary information is eliminated. To
restore it (b-4), RevIN reverses the instance normalization in the output layer.

sequence length Tx and the prediction length Ty can be different since the observations are normalized and denormalized across the temporal dimension, as will be explained below. Our proposed
method, RevIN, consists of symmetrically structured normalization-and-denormalization layers, as
illustrated in Fig. 2. First, we normalize the input data x[(][i][)] using its instance-specific mean and standard deviation, which is widely accepted as instance normalization (Ulyanov et al., 2016). The mean
and standard deviation are computed for every instance x[(]k[i]·[)] _[∈]_ [R][T][x][ of the input data (Fig. 2(a-3)) as]

Using these statistics, we normalize the input data x[(][i][)] (Fig. 2(a-1)) as

where γ, β ∈ R[K] are learnable affine parameter vectors. The normalized sequences can have a
more consistent mean and variance, where the non-stationary information is reduced. As a result, the
normalization layer allows the model to accurately predict the local dynamics within the sequence
while receiving inputs of consistent distributions in terms of the mean and variance.

The model then receives the transformed data ˆx[(][i][)] as input and forecasts their future values. However, the input data have different statistics than the original distribution, and by observing only
the normalized input ˆx[(][i][)], it is difficult to capture the original distribution of the input x[(][i][)]. Thus,
to make this easier for the model, we explicitly return the non-stationary properties removed from
the input data to the model output by reversing the normalization step at a symmetric position, the
output layer. A denormalization step can return the model output to the original time-series value as
well (Ogasawara et al., 2010). Accordingly, we denormalize the model output ˜y[(][i][)] by applying the

The same statistics used in the normalization step in Eq. 2 are used for the scaling and shifting. Now,
_yˆ[(][i][)]_ is the final prediction of the model instead of ˜y[(][i][)].

Simply added to virtually symmetric positions in a network, RevIN can effectively alleviate distribution discrepancy in time-series data, as a generally-applicable trainable normalization layer to
arbitrary deep neural networks. Indeed, the proposed method is a flexible, end-to-end trainable layer
that can be applied to any arbitrarily chosen layers, even to several layers. We verify its effectiveness
as a flexible layer by adding it to the intermediate layers in the model in Table 7 in Appendix A.4.
Nevertheless, RevIN is most effective when applied to virtually symmetric layers of encoder-decoder
structure. In a typical time-series forecasting model, the boundary between the encoder and the decoder is often unclear. Thus, we apply RevIN to the input and output layers of a model as they can
be interpreted as an encoder-decoder structure, generating subsequent values, given input data.

3.2 EFFECT OF REVERSIBLE INSTANCE NORMALIZATION ON DISTRIBUTION SHIFT


This section verifies that RevIN can alleviate the distribution discrepancy problem by removing
non-stationary information in the input layer and then restoring it in the output layer. We analyze the
distributions of the training and test data at each step of the proposed approach, as shown in Fig. 3.

When comparing the distribution of training and test data in each example (Fig. 3(a-b)), we can
observe that RevIN significantly reduces their discrepancy. To be specific, in the original input
(Fig. 3(a)), the training and test data distributions hardly overlap (especially ETTm1), which is
caused by the distribution shift problem. Also, each data distribution has multiple peaks (especially
the test data of ETTh1 and ECL), implying that sequences in the data might have severe discrepancies in their distributions. However, in the proposed approach, the normalization step transforms
each data distribution into mean-centered distributions (Fig. 3(b)). This result supports that the
original multimodal distributions (Fig. 3(a)) are caused by discrepancies in distributions between
different sequences in the data. Even more, the proposed approach makes training and test data distributions overlapped. This verifies that the normalization step of RevIN can alleviate the distribution
shift problem, reducing the distribution discrepancy between training and test data.


-----

Taking the normalized data as the input, the model can retain aligned training and test data distributions in the prediction output (Fig. 3(c)). As expected, these are then returned back to the original distribution by the denormalization step of RevIN (Fig. 3(d)). Without denormalization, the
model needs to reconstruct the values that follow the original distributions (Fig. 3(d)) using only
the normalized input that follows the transformed distributions where non-stationary information is
removed (Fig. 3(b)). Additionally, we hypothesize that the distribution discrepancy will be reduced
in the intermediate layers of the model as well, when RevIN is applied at the input and output layers
only, which will be discussed in Section 4.2.3. As a result, this RevIN procedure can be considered
to first make problems easier, and then restore them back to the original state, rather than directly
solving the challenging problem where the distribution shift problem exists.

4 EXPERIMENTS

This section describes the experimental setup and provides extensive experimental results of RevIN.

4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

**Datasets. We evaluate our methods mainly on four large-scale real-world time-series datasets. Ad-**
ditionally, we provide experimental results on three more datasets, including the air quality and Nasdaq datasets taken from the UCI repository and M4 competition dataset (Makridakis et al., 2020)
in Appendix A.1. (i) Electricity transformer temperature (ETT)[1] data consists of seven features,
including power load features and oil temperature. It is collected from two different regions in China
for two years. Following the same protocol as Informer (Zhou et al., 2021), we split the data into
three datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, and ETTm1. The ETTh1 and ETTh2 datasets are hourly data obtained from different regions. The ETTm1 dataset has a value every 15 minutes. For each dataset,
we split the first 12 months, the middle four months, and the last four months as training, validation,
and test data, respectively. (ii) Electricity Consuming Load (ECL)[2] data contains the electricity
consumption (kWh) collected from 321 clients. Following the prior work (Zhou et al., 2021), data
from each client is used as a variable on an hourly basis in the multivariate forecasting setting. For
the ECL dataset, we use 15, 3, and 4 months as training, validation, and test data, respectively.

**Experimental details. We set the prediction lengths to be one day (1d), 2d, 7d, 14d, 30d, and 40d**
for the hourly-basis datasets, ETTh1, ETTh2, and ECL. For the ETTm1 dataset, we chose six hours
(6h), 12h, 3d, 7d, and 14d as the prediction window lengths. We evaluate the time-series forecasting
performance on the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Following the same
evaluation procedure used in the previous study (Zhou et al., 2021), we compute the MSE and MAE
on z-score normalized data to measure different variables on the same scale. More details on experimental settings, including training details and hyperparameters, are provided in Appendix A.11.

**Baselines compared. RevIN is a model-agnostic method, generally applicable to any deep neural**
network. In this paper, we verify the effectiveness of RevIN by adopting it to three state-of-the-art
time-series forecasting models: Informer (Zhou et al., 2021), N-BEATS (Oreshkin et al., 2020), and
SCINet (Liu et al., 2021). These are non-autoregressive forecasting models. The reproduction details
for the baselines are provided in Appendix A.12. Unless stated otherwise, we compare RevIN and
the baselines under the same hyperparameter settings, including the input and prediction lengths.

achieving state-of-the-art performance on the four datasets. Moreover, the effectiveness of RevIN
is more evident for the long sequence prediction, where it remarkably reduces the errors of the
baselines. RevIN shows a stable performance in contrast to the baselines, which show a high increase
in error as prolonging the prediction length. For example, when the prediction length increases from
24 to 960 on the ETTh2 dataset, the forecasting error of N-BEATS significantly increases from
0.403 to 6.408. In contrast, RevIN shows a much slight increase in error, i.e., from 0.192 to 0.471.
A similar tendency appears with the other prediction lengths, datasets, and baseline models as well.
These results demonstrate that RevIN makes the baseline model more robust to prediction length.

We further quantitatively analyze the effect of RevIN on long sequence prediction in Table 2. When
the model prediction length is increased from 48 to 960, RevIN reduces the prediction error compared to the baseline, showing robust performance against the prediction length. The difference in
the forecasting error between SCINet and RevIN is relatively small when the prediction length is
short (e.g., 48), but RevIN remarkably surpasses SCINet by a significant margin when the prediction
length is long (e.g., 336, 720, and 960). These results substantiate that adopting RevIN can make a
model robust to the prediction length.

Additionally, to study how RevIN can perform well in long sequence prediction, we visualize
the forecasting error for each time step in Fig. 4. The error at the t-th time step is computed as
MSE-to the baselines; the performance degradation is significantly slower, showing low error even whent = _N1_ _Ni=1_ _K1_ _Kk=1[(ˆ]ykt[(][i][)]_ _[−]_ _[y]kt[(][i][)][)][2][. Overall, RevIN shows superior performance compared]_

forecasting 960 steps ahead. Specifically, for N-BEATS and SCINet, the error extremely increasesP P
as predicting the distant future values. RevIN alleviates this significant increase in error, showing
remarkable performance compared to the baselines. Informer also shows unstable performance for
the different time steps. The error is substantial in the early steps and becomes relatively small in
the distant steps. RevIN allows the models to have consistently minor errors in every time step, even
where the baselines originally show high error (early steps for Informer, distant steps for N-BEATS
and SCINet). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of RevIN when forecasting long sequences.

4.2.2 COMPARISON WITH EXISTING NORMALIZATION METHODS

We compare RevIN with classical and state-of-the-art normalization methods, including minmax normalization, z-score normalization, layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016), batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), instance normalization (Ulyanov et al., 2016), and deep adaptive input

normalization (DAIN) (Passalis et al., 2019) in Table 3. Here, we compute the statistics for min-max
and z-score normalization methods for every input instance, not for the entire data. Additionally, we
attempt to use batch normalization as the input normalization method in RevIN, named reversible
batch normalization (RevBN). Layer normalization cannot be used in a similar manner since it is
not reversible when the input and prediction lengths are different, as in our experimental settings.

As a result, RevIN shows outstanding performance compared to the other normalization methods,
especially on ETTh2 and ETTm1 datasets. Also, RevBN improves forecasting performance of batch
normalization. Specifically, the error considerably decreases in the long sequence prediction, such as
960 and 1344. This result supports that the denormalization step of RevIN is essential as a key component of the proposed method for improving long sequence forecasting. However, batch normalization applies identical normalization to all the input sequences, using the global statistics obtained
from the entire training data; it can not reduce the discrepancy between the training and test data
distributions. Consequently, RevIN, which transforms the data in the instance level, outperforms
RevBN by a significant margin, demonstrating that successfully reducing the discrepancy between
distributions of different input sequences can effectively improve performance. Moreover, RevIN not
only shows the best performance but also has the advantage of being lightweight compared to the
baselines. For example, when K is the number of variables, DAIN requires at least 3K [2] additional
parameters, whereas RevIN only requires 2K additional parameters.

4.2.3 ANALYSIS OF DISTRIBUTION SHIFT IN THE INTERMEDIATE LAYERS


In Fig. 5, we analyze the feature divergence between the training and test data to verify that RevIN
can reduce the distribution shift at the intermediate feature level as well. We conduct the experiment
using Informer as the baseline; it comprises two encoder layers and one decoder layer. Thus, we analyze the features of the first (Layer-1) and the second (Layer-2) encoder layers. Following the prior
work (Pan et al., 2018), we compute the average feature divergence using symmetric KL divergence
(See Appendix A.10). The results show that RevIN significantly reduces the feature divergence between the training and test data in both layers, demonstrating that the proposed approach, when
added only to the input and output layers, successfully alleviates the distribution shift problem in the
intermediate layers. Moreover, this strengthens RevIN as a generally-applicable flexible layer. An
arbitrary model can adopt RevIN by adding it to input and output layers without any architectural
modifications. Note that our approach still can be added to any arbitrarily chosen layers, significantly
improving the model performance, as shown in Appendix A.4.

5 CONCLUSION


This paper aims to address the distribution shift problem in time series, proposing a simple yet effective normalization-and-denormalization method, reversible instance normalization (RevIN). The
proposed approach effectively alleviates the discrepancy between training and test data distributions, leading to significant performance improvements in time-series forecasting. As a generallyapplicable layer to arbitrary deep neural networks, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on seven real-world time-series datasets by a significant margin. The extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with in-depth analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of RevIN for
accurate time-series forecasting against the distribution shift problem.

We evaluate the proposed method on the four large-scale real-world time-series datasets, the ETTh1,
ETTh2, ETTm1, and ECL datasets in the main manuscript. Additionally, this section provides experimental results on three more datasets, including two real-world datasets taken from the UCI
repository, the air quality dataset and the Nasdaq dataset, and the M4 competition dataset (Makridakis et al., 2020). In total, our proposed method is evaluated on seven datasets in this paper.

**Air quality[3]** dataset contains hourly averaged responses collected from five metal oxide chemical
sensors located in Italy. The data consist of 13 variables of length 9537. We set the prediction length
as {24, 48, 168, 336, 720} and the corresponding input length as {48, 96, 168, 168, 360} so that
their ratios become {2x, 2x, 1x, 0.5x, 0.5x}.

**Nasdaq[4]** dataset consists of 82 variables, including important indices of markets around the world,
the price of major companies in the U.S. market, treasury bill rates, etc. It is measured daily, having
a total of 1984 data samples for each variable. We prolong the prediction length as {30, 60, 120}
and set the corresponding input length as 60 for all.

Figure 6: Prediction results on the Nasdaq dataset. The results on three variables in the data,
Close, DTB6, and DE1, are shown. The prediction length is 60 days, and the seventh value is illustrated to show the results on the entire test set. We compare RevIN with N-BEATS.

**M4[5]** competition dataset consists of six different hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and
yearly sets, containing 100,000 test data. We follow the original experimental protocol of the M4
competition (Makridakis et al., 2020). For evaluation, we measure the micro-averaged mean absolute error and mean squared error: we first compute the metric independently for each set, i.e.,
hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly sets, and then calculate the weighted average of
the metrics using the contributions of each set as the weights.

As shown in Table 4, RevIN significantly improves the forecasting performance of the baselines on
all three datasets. Notably, RevIN shows outstanding performance on the Nasdaq dataset, reducing
the prediction errors by more than half compared to the baselines.

Additionally, we conduct a qualitative analysis on the Nasdaq dataset to verify the effectiveness
of our method on obvious non-stationary time series. As shown in Fig. 6, the Nasdaq index (the
variable ’Close’) has steadily increased since 2010. Accordingly, when data are divided into the
training and test data based on a specific point in time (vertical dashed line in Fig. 6), the test data
values tend to be higher than the training data values. In other words, the data severely suffers
from the distribution shift problem, where the training and test data show a discrepancy in their
distribution. As a result, even existing state-of-the-art models often cannot predict the future values
appropriately, as shown in Fig. 6. The baseline fails to keep up with the trend in data, whose mean
value continues to increase, and thus the prediction results are shifted. However, RevIN mitigates
this distribution discrepancy and remarkably increases the prediction performance of the baseline.

Similarly, RevIN shows superior performance on the other rapidly increasing data (’DTB6’ in Fig. 6)
and the decreasing test data (‘DE1’ in Fig. 6), accurately predicting the changing mean of the data.

A.2 CROSS-DOMAIN TIME-SERIES FORECASTING

the ETT datasets, ETTh1, ETTh2, and ETTm1. We train RevIN using SCINet as the baseline. We
report the average errors and the standard deviation values for five runs.

As RevIN can alleviate the distribution discrepancy between the training and test data, we investigate
the ability of RevIN in mitigating distribution discrepancy between different domains through crossdomain time-series forecasting task. In time series, a domain can be a location of a sensor where
the data is collected. We use the ETT datasets for the experiment since they have the same feature
categories. However, their distributions can exhibit significant discrepancy because the ETTh1 and
ETTh2 datasets are collected from different locations, and the ETTh and ETTm1 datasets have different measurement time intervals. Thus, we alternately use each ETT dataset as a source domain
for training and a target domain for testing. The goal of cross-domain time-series forecasting is to
alleviate the data distribution discrepancy between the source and target domains, e.g., between the
ETTh1 and ETTh2 datasets.

normalization and denormalization steps. Thus, the input sequence length would play a crucial role
in the prediction accuracy and stability of the training process. Accordingly, we prolong the model
input sequence length to see its impact on the forecasting performance of RevIN, as shown in Fig. 7.
As a result, RevIN consistently outperforms the baseline for various input sequence lengths. More
importantly, RevIN makes the baseline models more robust to the input length. In other words,
RevIN shows stable performance for various input lengths in contrast to the baseline models, which
shows the high variance in their performance according to the input length. Notably, in N-BEATS,
the average error, as well as the standard deviation of the error, significantly increase as prolonging
the input length. This is because the trend in data is expressed as a linear function in N-BEATS.
As the input length becomes prolonged, there is a chance that the variance (or non-stationarity) in
the time-series values will become higher, decreasing the accuracy of the linear trend to fit the data
unless the data is monotonically increasing or decreasing. Also, the mispredicted trends linearly
increase the error in future values. However, when N-BEATS adopts the RevIN layer, it removes
the non-stationary statistics from the input, and thus, the model shows robust performance against
the input length. Removing the variability, i.e., normalizing its mean and standard deviation, before
feeding it to the model and returning it to the output makes the model learning stable.

We ablate the affine transformation from RevIN to analyze its impact on forecasting performance.
We conduct the analysis on the ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ECL, Nasdaq, and air quality datasets using
N-BEATS as the baseline. The results in Table 6 show that the affine transformation consistently
contributes to performance improvement on a variety of datasets. As mentioned earlier, a model
can add RevIN in an intermediate layer, even to several layers. While existing approaches are a
preprocessing-and-postprocessing method applied outside of the main prediction model, RevIN is
an end-to-end trainable layer that can be added to any layer in the model as batch normalization (Ioffe
& Szegedy, 2015) and instance normalization (Ulyanov et al., 2016), which are recently proposed
deep learning-based normalization layers. Thus, we verify that adopting RevIN in the intermediate
layers instead of the input and output layers can improve the forecasting performance as well. We
add RevIN to the first stack of N-BEATS and SCINet and evaluate their performance on the six
datasets. The results in Table 7 demonstrate that even when added to the intermediate layers, RevIN
improves the performance of the baselines, as a learnable normalization layer. We mainly focus on
adding RevIN to the input and output of a model since it shows robust performance on average.
Nevertheless, the model adopting RevIN in the intermediate layers consistently outperforms the
baseline without RevIN, frequently achieving the best performance among all. This performance
is even better than the dynamic normalization methods, LSTNet[∗] and ES-RNN[∗], when they are

adopted to N-BEATS as well (See Table 9 in Appendix A.6). For example, when the prediction
length is 960, the mean squared errors of LSTNet[∗], ES-RNN[∗], RevIN (inter.), and RevIN (i/o) are
5.627, 1.338, 0.523, and 0.471, on average. In conclusion, RevIN is a flexible, end-to-end trainable

A.5 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION ON SIMILARITY METRICS FOR TIME SERIES

We evaluate the forecasting performance of RevIN mainly on the mean squared error and the mean
absolute error. Additionally, we use complementary metrics that measure the similarity between two
sequences, dynamic time warping (DTW) and temporal distortion index (TDI) (Le Guen & Thome,
2019; Fr´ıas-Paredes et al., 2017). Table 8 shows that our approach significantly improves the baseline models across all datasets in terms of the DTW and TDI. Notably, RevIN exhibits outstanding
performance by a large margin compared to the baselines for long prediction length. For example,
when RevIN is added, the average DTW decreases from 38.348 to 15.240 for Informer, from 53.148
to 12.766 for N-BEATS, and from 20.498 to 11.080 for SCINet when the prediction length is 960 on
ETTh2. There are a few cases where the proposed method predicts a less similar sequence than the
baseline. However, the margin is minimal in terms of either DTW or TDI compared to the significant
margin found when our method outperforms the baseline. These results demonstrate that adopting
RevIN can generate a sequence more similar to the groundtruth than the baseline, especially showing
better prediction accuracy on the longer sequences.

Table 8: Comparison results on similarity metrics for time series. We assess the model forecasting results in terms of the shape and temporal errors using the DTW and the TDI, respectively (the
lower, the better). The experiments are conducted for the four datasets, using the three baselines. We
report the average value and standard deviation of five experiments.

Figure 8: Effect of RevIN on distribution discrepancy on training and test data compared to
**existing dynamic normalization methods. We compare RevIN with LSTNet[∗], which adds the**
autoregressive linear bypass module of LSTNet to the baseline and ES-RNN[∗], which adds the exponential smoothing of ES-RNN to the baseline. The analysis is conducted on the ETTh2 dataset with
a prediction length of 960 using N-BEATS as the baseline. From left to right, the columns compare
the training and test data distributions of each step of the sequential process in each method.


A.6 COMPARISON WITH EXISTING DYNAMIC NORMALIZATION METHODS

We compare RevIN with the dynamic normalization methods proposed in LSTNet (Lai et al., 2017)
and ES-RNN (Smyl, 2020). Similar to adding RevIN to the baseline model, we add the autoregressive linear bypass module of LSTNet and the modified Holt-Winters exponential smoothing of ESRNN to the baseline model, respectively. As shown in Table 9, RevIN consistently achieves the best
performance among the normalization methods adopted on N-BEATS by a significant margin. When
we replace RevIN with the other normalization methods, the autoregressive linear bypass module of
LSTNet (LSTNet[∗]) also consistently reduces the prediction error compared to the baseline. However, the performance improvement is smaller than our method. For example, when the prediction
length is 960 on the ETTh2 dataset, N-BEATS shows an average error of 6.408, and LSTNet[∗] reduces the error to 5.627. But this is still much worse than RevIN, which reduces the error to 0.471.
Similarly, when the prediction length is 1344 on the ETTm1 dataset, the baseline shows an average
error of 14.613 and LSTNet[∗] largely decreases the error to 5.592, but RevIN more significantly decreases the error to 0.631. In the case of ES-RNN[∗], the training of the model is unstable, failing to
converge for several cases. Also, ES-RNN[∗] often degrades the baseline performance, e.g., when the
prediction length is either 24 or 48 on the ETTh1 and ETTm1 datasets. It significantly reduces the
error for long prediction length much better than LSTNet[∗], but still worse than RevIN, for example,
when the prediction length is 960 on the ETTh2 dataset.

Additionally, we further analyze the data distributions of the dynamic normalization methods on the
ETTh2 dataset, as shown in Fig. 8. We compare the training and test data distributions of each step
of the sequential process in each method.

**ES-RNN[∗]** shows the distributions of (a) the original model input, (b) the normalized input where the
level and seasonality are removed by its proposed method, (c) the model prediction output, (d) the
denormalized output where the level and seasonality is multiplied back to the original distribution.

**LSTNet[∗]** shows the distributions of (a) the original model input, (b) the same original input since
the method does not transform the input data before feeding them to the main prediction model, the
model prediction output (c) before, and (d) after adding the output of the autoregressive network.

**RevIN shows the distributions of (a) the original model input, (b) the normalized input by RevIN,**
(c) the model prediction output, and (d) the denormalized output by RevIN.

In Fig. 8(a), the original training and test data show a discrepancy in their distributions. Also, they
have several peaks, not being centered on the mean. This implies that sequences in the data will
have different mean values. In Fig. 8(b), both RevIN and ES-RNN[∗] transform data distributions
into mean-centered distributions. Particularly, ES-RNN[∗] extremely concentrates the distribution on
the mean, with only a small variance. Both RevIN and ES-RNN[∗] result in data sequences with
similar statistics, thereby alleviating the distribution shift problem in the input data. This leads to
outstanding performance on long prediction sequences, in contrast to LSTNet[∗]. LSTNet[∗] cannot
resolve the distribution discrepancy because it does not have any module that can change the input
statistics. Also, in LSTNet[∗], the distributions of the model output (Fig. 8(c)) completely differ from
the input data distributions (Fig. 8(b)). The method cannot make the input and output distribution
to be consistent. In addition, its proposed autoregressive model barely affects the model output
distributions, as shown in Fig. 8(c-d); there is almost no difference between the model output and
the final output distributions.

Most importantly, the distributions of the final output (Fig. 8(d)) significantly differ from the original
data (Fig. 8(a)) in LSTNet[∗]. Similarly, although ES-RNN[∗] alleviates the distribution discrepancy
in the input data, it fails to return the model output (Fig. 8(d)) back to the original distribution
(Fig. 8(a)), especially with the test data. These results imply that LSTNet[∗] and ES-RNN[∗] fail to
learn the appropriate data distribution, and this could be the main reason why their prediction error
is higher than RevIN. On the other hand, in RevIN, the distributions of the final output (Fig. 8(d)) are
successfully returned to the original distributions (Fig. 8(a)). Also, with RevIN, the input and output
of the model maintain consistent distributions, as well as the training and test data be overlapped.
As a result, RevIN shows superior performance than the other dynamic normalization methods.

A.7 ADDITIONAL RESULTS ON COMPARISON WITH EXISTING NORMALIZATION METHODS

This section provides complete results that compare with existing normalization methods, which are
not included in the main manuscript due to lack of space. The forecasting error of RevIN and existing
normalization methods are evaluated on the ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, and ECL datasets in Table 10.
RevIN consistently outperforms the other normalization methods across all datasets. Interestingly,
when the denormalization step is added to batch normalization (RevBN) as RevIN, the model better
forecasts long sequences than batch normalization (Batch norm), e.g., when the prediction length is
960. The denormalization step of RevIN plays a critical role in improving model performance by
restoring the model prediction to the original distribution. However, a denormalization step cannot
be added to DAIN since it has the Hadamard multiplication operation in the last step, which is not
reversible when the input and prediction sequence lengths are different. These differences could
be the reason for its worse performance compared to RevIN despite that DAIN requires higher
computational costs and a larger amount of model parameters.

A.8 ALGORITHM OF REVERSIBLE INSTANCE NORMALIZATION

Algorithm 1 summarizes the procedure of the proposed approach. Reversible instance normalization
consists of the normalization (line 3-4) and denormalization layers (line 6-7). It transforms the input
and output of a model using identical statistics. As RevIN is generally applicable, gθ in Algorithm 1
(line 5) can be any arbitrary deep neural network.

**Algorithm 1: RevIN, applied to input x and output y of a module in the model.**

**Input : Tx** R[1], the input sequence length; x[(]kt[i][)]

A.9 THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION OF REVIN AGAINST DISTRIBUTION SHIFT

Let x[(][i][)] _∈_ R[K][×][T][x] denote a time series comprising K variables of length Tx. Consider a univariate
case where K = 1 without the loss of generality. Then, x[(][i][)] _∈_ R[T][x] denotes the i-th time series
in the data. Consider training and test data, whose distributions are denoted as Ptra and Ptst, respectively. We consider a distribution shift problem where the training and test data have different
distributions (Du et al., 2021). That is,

_Ptra(x)_ = Ptst(x). (4)
_̸_

In our work, we consider the distribution shift problem in terms of the mean and the variance. Then,
the distribution shift problem can be redefined as

E[xtra] ̸= E[xtst] or Var[xtra] ̸= Var[xtst], for xtra ∼ _Ptra, xtst ∼_ _Ptst._ (5)

Let’s assume that the given training and test data suffer from the distribution shift problem in terms
of the mean and variance. In order to solve this problem, RevIN first normalizes a training sample


-----

_x[(][i][)]_ _Ptra. Mathematically, a training sample is transformed as_
_∼_

_xˆ[(][i][)]_ = _[x][(][i][)]Var[[ −]_ [E]x[[][x][(][i][(][)][i]][)][]] _· γ + β._ (6)

By the laws of expectation and variance, p

E[ˆx[(][i][)]] = β and Var[ˆx[(][i][)]] = γ[2], for all i. (7)

By symmetry, this also holds for x[(][i][)] _Ptst, for all i. Therefore, the mean and variance of the_
_∼_
training and test data distributions become identical. Thus, by definition (Eq. 5), the distribution
shift problem for the training and test data is solved by the first step of RevIN.

Given the normalized time-series data, the forecasting model parameterized by θ, fθ : R[T][x] _→_ R[T][y],
predicts the corresponding subsequent future values, ˜y = fθ(ˆx). Then, the denormalization step of
RevIN returns the non-stationary information of the original data, i.e., E[x[(][i][)]] and Var[x[(][i][)]] in Eq. 6,
to the prediction output so that model does not have to reconstruct them from the normalized input.
In summary, the model prediction ˜y[(][i][)] is denormalized as


_y[(][i][)]_ _β_
_yˆ[(][i][)]_ = [˜] _−_


Var[x[(][i][)]] + E[x[(][i][)]]. (8)


By the laws of expectation and variance, the mean and variance of ˆy[(][i][)] can be expressed as

E[ˆy[(][i][)]] = ∆+ E[x[(][i][)]] and Var[ˆy[(][i][)]] = λ · Var[x[(][i][)]]. (9)

The denormalization step allows the mean and variance of the final prediction values to be expressed
as the difference from the input statistics. Here, since the input data x[(][i][)] and the groundtruth future
values are consecutive sequences, we can assume that their difference in the mean and variance
can be expressed as Eq. 9 as well. Under this assumption, the model adopting RevIN only needs to
capture the difference from the input statistics, ∆ and λ, to accurately predict the statistics of the
future values. In conclusion, through the normalization and denormalization steps of RevIN, a model
can focus on learning the offset from the input distribution to the output distribution by removing
their common non-stationary statistics.

A.10 CALCULATION DETAILS ON FEATURE DIVERGENCE

This section explains how the feature divergence is computed in Section 4.2.3. Following the previous work (Pan et al., 2018), we calculate the average feature divergence between the training and
test data using symmetric KL divergence, assuming that the output features of the model layer will
follow a Gaussian distribution with mean µ and variance σ[2]. Then, the equation for the feature
divergence of the k-th feature fk can be expressed as


_D(fk[train]||fk[test][) =][ KL][(][f][ train]k_ _||fk[test]2_ [) +][ KL]A [(][f][ test]k _[||][f][ train]k_ ), (10)

_k_ _k_ + (µk _k_ [)][2]
where _KL(fk[A]_ _k_ [) = log][ σ][B] + _[σ][A]_ 2[−] _[µ][B]_ (11)

_[||][f][ B]_ _σk[A]_ 2σk[B] _−_ [1]2 _[.]_

A.11 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

We train and evaluate the models using the following seeds: 12, 22, 32, 42, and 52. The experiments
using N-BEATS and Informer as the baseline are performed on NVIDIA TITAN RTX, and the
experiments using SCINet are conducted on NVIDIA TITAN Xp. Following the multivariate timeseries forecasting settings of the previous studies (Zhou et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021), we select
input sequence length from two days (2d), 4d, 7d, 14d, 15d, 20d, 28d, 30d for the hourly datasets,
i.e., the ETTh1, ETTh2, and ECL datasets, and from half day, 1d, 3.5d, 7d for the ETTm1 dataset.
Particularly, we set the ratio of input length to prediction length to be smaller from 2.0 to 0.35 as the
prediction length becomes longer. In the case of SCINet, when the prediction length is 720, we set
its input length to be 736, unlike the other baselines. It is because the original paper of the method
requires its input sequence length to meet a specific condition. To be specific, the input length needs
to be a multiple of 32 due to its hierarchical architecture (Liu et al., 2021).

A.12 REPRODUCTION DETAILS FOR BASELINE MODELS

This section describes the implementation details of the baselines, Informer, N-BEATS, and SCINet.
Note that we compare each baseline model and RevIN using the same hyperparameters except for
the presence of RevIN. We exactly follow the experimental settings of the baseline models by using
their official code to conduct experiments, except for N-BEATS that have no officially released code.
We reproduce the model and set hyperparameters as stated in the original N-BEATS paper.

**Informer. We use the official open-source code of Informer** [6]. If provided, we follow the same hyperparameter settings in training the network, e.g., hidden dimension of the network or the learning
rate. For the ECL dataset, detailed hyperparameter settings are not officially provided in Informer;
we use the same settings with the ETTh1 dataset.

**N-BEATS. We reproduce N-BEATS using the PyTorch framework (Paszke et al., 2019). We follow**
the same hyperparameter settings of the N-BEATS-I model in the original paper. We train N-BEATS
to minimize the mean squared error between the model prediction and groundtruth values. For a fair
comparison with the other baselines, we use a single model instead of using the ensemble method
originally proposed in the N-BEATS paper. Since N-BEATS is a model tailored to univariate timeseries forecasting, we flatten each multivariate input sequence into a univariate sequence having a
single dimension for the feature before feeding it to the model. Additionally, we conduct a grid
search for the learning rate of N-BEATS with the range of [1e-5, 1e-3] and train the model using the
weight decay with the factor of 0.001 to stabilize training.

**SCINet. We follow the experimental settings provided in the official code** [7] of SCINet.

A.13 ADDITIONAL QUALITATIVE RESULTS

In Fig. 9, we illustrate the additional results comparing the predictions of RevIN and the baselines.
Overall, the prediction results of the baselines are inaccurately scaled and shifted. However, RevIN
shows remarkable performance, consistently improving the baselines to predict more precise results.
With RevIN, the forecasting results are better aligned with the groundtruth.

A.14 COMPLETE QUANTITATIVE RESULTS

Table 11 provides the standard deviation values of five independent experiments to compare long
sequence forecasting performance in Table 2 in the main manuscript. Table 12 shows the complete
results of the comparison of the forecasting errors between the baselines and RevIN in Table 1 in the
main manuscript. They include the standard deviation of five runs and the performance reported in
the original papers of the baselines. RevIN shows significant performance improvement compared
to the state-of-the-art forecasting baselines.
